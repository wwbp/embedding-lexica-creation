# Lexica

## File structure
- File Structure
    - Method directories
        - Each method will have its own directory containing all the code necessary to reproduce the results. 
    - Lexica directory
        - One directory for each method that contains all the lexica generated using the method for the following datasets
            - yelp_subset train set
            - amazon_finefood_subset train set
            - amazon_toys_subset train set
            - nrc_joy train set
            - nrc_fear train set
            - nrc_anger train set
            - nrc_sadness train set
            - nrc_surprise train set
            - empathy train set
        - For each lexicon, the name of the file is in the format of '[method]_[dataset].csv' where [method] can be [model]_[feature importance measure]. For example, 'ffn_deepshap_yelp_subset.csv'
        - For each lexicon, the csv file should contain three columns with name 'word, score, word_count' respectively, so that they can be easily fed into the lexica evaluation pipeline. Do not include index when writing out the csv file. 
    - Evaluation directory
        - It contains the lexica evaluation pipeline that can be used commonly across all methods (Roshan) and the evaluation results including F1, Accuracy and other metrics for both lexica and models
        - Positive/Negative evaluations
            - Train on:
                - yelp_subset train set
                - amazon_finefood_subset train set
                - amazon_toys_subset train set
                - empathy train set
                - nrc_joy train set
            - Evalutate on:
                - yelp_subset test set
                - amazon_finefood_subset test set
                - amazon_toys_subset test set
                - empathy test set
                - nrc_joy test set
                - song_joy
                - dialog_joy
                - friends_joy
                - emobank
        - Emotional Label evaluations
            - Train on:
                - nrc_[EMO] train set
            - Evaluate on:
                - nrc_[EMO]  test set
                - song_[EMO] 
                - dialog_[EMO] 
                - friends_[EMO] 
            - Where [EMO] = {joy, fear, anger, sadness, surprise}
