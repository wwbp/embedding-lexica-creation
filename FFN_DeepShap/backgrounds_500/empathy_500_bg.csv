this kind of stuff always makes me afraid to even go outside.If there is something to catch someone will just bring it to others and it is just something that is horrible and not what I would want to put onto others.It makes me afraid that it could spread and would make things worse for everyone and drive others to panic.,1
"This ticks me off for two reasons: One, that we've messed up the Australian ecosystem so badly, and two, that people are going to read it and say ""Oh, no, it wasn't climate change at all, so we don't have to do anything to fix it."" Either way, it was man-made problems that did this little guy in. I wish they would blame it thoroughly on climate change, so people would maybe be spurred to do something. Instead, right now they'll say ""Oh, it wasn't *really* climate change,"" and when a more clear-cut extinction happens, they'll point back to this and say ""Well, it's been going on for a long time now, nothing we can do."" Christ.",1
"Get too close to a skunk, and it will spray you with a noxious mix of sulphuric thiols, the chemicals in raw onions that make you cry.The spray doesn't just stink: it chokes your lungs and causes temporary blindness, allowing the skunk to get away.The scent is produced in anal glands at the base of the tail, and is fired through nipples attached to the glands. Impressive muscle control allows skunks to target their enemy's face at a distance of over 2m.Without this deterrent, the slow-moving skunks would be unable to escape from predators.",1
Apparently an actor was found dead in a Talk show host's home. Not sure what occurred but you have to feel sorry for those close to them. I certainly don't want to be negative and assume that demons finally caught up with him or an assault of some sort occurred but it is odd and they clearly have family who lost a loved one. It a shame that someone with talent to entertain and act would lose their life at a younger age and I guess it could be any of us but it's sad foor thoose  who knew him and my heart goes out to them.,1
"These poor people! It seems like they really can't catch a break. Like it isn't bad enough that they are already trying to dig themselves out of their tough economic situation and losing their homes, but now they also have to worry about a population decrease. It's pretty clear that we need more aid and more help for these people in the area.",1
"There has got to be a better solution that we can all come up with to make sure that these deaths are stopped or at least decreased. I understand making sure that the elephants are safe, but people should take priority as well. There are people fearing for their lives. What can their country do about it, and if their country can't, when will another country come in and offer their assistance?",1
I think what the father did was a noble gesture.  Sometimes justice isn't always served in jail.  I think it is a shame that he is being punished for what he did.  What is more important however is that the father got his revenge.  Sometimes it is necessary to take justice in your own hands.  I applaud the father for what he did.,1
It is very sad to know Robert died. He was a great actor. You never now when your time is going to come. I get very worried of my own health. There are so many sicknesses and diseases. I tried to get checked annually at the doctors. I hope they come out with a cure for these diseases and sicknesses. I feel like Robert did live kind of a long life. Robert has made good memories and I think that is very important when living . I want to make a lot of good memories now that I'm alive. Everyones life should have meaning just like Robert's.,1
"Of course they don't see well as they age! They're so much like us, even in the small details of how they stretch their arms to be able to perform their work. Just like my dad when he can't find his glasses and tries to read his magazine. I can't even comprehend why some people won't see how similar animals are to humans - how actually humans are animals. It blows my mind every day.",1
"Awful news article. Us as a society need to do a better job of protecting and helping not only our planet, but the animals and mammals that surround it. The fact that almost 100 percent of the caimans are suspected to be dead is alarming and people should be more informed on such matters. The rate of extinction that these animals and mammals are going through on our planet is extremely alarming and I can not figure out why people aren't more concerned or even aware of the matter. We need to do a better job of protecting ALL living matter on this planet, not just ourselves.",1
"This article I just read is incredibly intellectually dishonest. The notion that women were somehow exiled from talking points and inclusion in the Trump campaign is actually nauseating. This kind of narrative is truly what the modern liberal exists upon. It's disgusting. I'm not a Trump fan, but mark my words, this kind of crap will be the reason why he wins in 2020.",1
"I'm saddened to hear the news about his passing.  In my experience I believe that comedians get into the field due to an aspect of the desire to help people and give them a few laughs.  Don't think I recall his comedy acts but reading through the tributes I get the sense that people liked him alright and that he was a good guy.  His tagline is great - ""that's not right.""  As if he internalized a solid sense of right and wrong.  So I didn't know his work but I think I like him.",1
What I learned about nature is that they cannot be predicted. Nature can look beautiful in one instance and can kill you in the next. Take a look at this shark incident. poor guy was play a game with some buddies and lost his life for no reason. Today you are here and tomorrow you are gone. Try to live as long as you possibly can before some shit comes along and tries to take it away.,1
Micheal Moore was right about this. Trump could and did win. The more we dismissed him the stronger he got. I can't stand his attitude and his lack of compassion. But I can understand how he won. Voters were fed up with the traditional lifetime politicians. I think Hillary lost the election more than Trump won it. A lot of people didn't trust her and wanted a change. Now good or bad we have change.,1
"I think this article is really inspirational. I didn't realize how much food we waste and how inefficient we are in this respect. I would like to change the way the world behave but this would be a big undertaking and I think it may be too big. There are small and big things that we can do with our daily meals and meal planning that can help with this problem of food waste but I think it will take more time and money to implement it. And im not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0% waste. If it gets us less than 1% more efficiency in how we use food, than it may not be worth the effort, and we may need to look at other ideas. Combating food waste could also lead to an increase it food poisoning since questionable foods in our refrigerator are thrown away as a precaution.",1
"I'm really confused at why multiple articles were mushed together like this. At first I was perturbed at the first article because I felt like the lady was being ridiculous. She weighs 500 pounds, so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight, the fact that she can't find a scale to weigh her doesn't matter. You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying. I can't believe the terrible things people do to one another :(",1
"It is very upsetting to hear about a family losing their children in such a freak accident way. As a parent myself I can only imagine the horrible feelings that this family is going through and how everyone must be feeling right now to lose these little girls as such a young age. No one should have to bury their own children, it is just terrible.",1
France plans to shut down the jungle as they call it. This was where they kept illegal immigrants trying to make their way to Britain. I certainly feel for anyone looking for a better life and at times wish all countries had open borders as this one isn't so great at times but we do have laws and many immigrants enter other countries legally and I think there needs to be some sort of controls that make the process fair to legal citizens. I feel for the immigrants but it's hard to support their actions when they could also do so legally as opposed to sneaking in by way of hiding in trucks.,1
"I just don't understand how this is the country that we all say we love and adore, but yet when others come here there are so many stipulations for them, and then even when they succeed at jumping through all of the hoops they are forced to, they have even more guidelines behind that. It's just so unfortunate that these refugees will feel unsafe and ultimately feel like refugees for the rest of their lives.",1
"This article highlights the fact that we might be going on about our lives, secure in the knowledge that everything is fine, but then suddenly when you least expect it, we are reminded of our own mortality. It makes me want to live each and every day as well as I can, because I never know if it might be my last. Sometimes we think we have forever, but this article is a reminder that each day we live on this Earth, imperfect though it may be, is a gift.",1
"JUst when you think things couldn't get much worse! I just can't imagine who in the world would kill, then mutilate a baby horse! It pretty much sounds like someone with a mental health issue is running around crazy with a gun. It is nice to know so many nonprofits are not only engaged in finding this criminal, but also to prevent this from happening again, I think the adult horses  were in better shape and that's why they survived. What kind of lazy loon would mutilate the little horse's genitals?",1
"This article I just read was so, unbelievably sad and tragic.  This incident is so horrible.  Such a gruesome death.  I can't imagine being that two year old and falling for so long.  Ugh, it makes me so upset.  I feel so bad for the parents, they must feel so guilty.  It would be so hard to overcome everything.",1
I think its sick having these kids working. These kids should be playing and having an education. Why are they doing this? This just shows you how much people care about money. Its disgusting. Human beings are disgusting. I feel so ashamed. God will punish all of these people. We are just being controlled. Someone needs to put this to an end. I really hope these children get the life they deserve. This is why there is a lot of people suffering from depression because of these terrible things going on.,1
"It is known that colonoscopy saves lives, but the preparation can be so unpleasant. I am so happy that researchers are working towards making it more tolerable so that more people will undergo the procedure that can save their lives. I am happy that many different options are available: not all involving colon cleansing (e.g. X-rays), that there is a dietary advice to minimize the discomfort (which food to eat before the procedure), etc. So, the person’s quality of life, their well-being in the short term is taken seriously into account.",1
hello brother I am learning the news I am very happy that you are already in sacrament I am happy that after completing your dream of playing in the NBA is a great time for you and you should know how to take advantage of this great opportunity take care of yourself and succeed.I'm really very proud of you,1
"How can anyone, in this day and age, still believe that climate change is not real? I imagine it's the same people who believe the earth is flat. We should be working towards clean and renewable energy but of course there are fights all across the way because people want to make money. Also replacing infrastructure is hard. But, that's not an excuse when you know that entire parts of the country might expand into a desert. This is especially true of North America.",1
"It is just so messed up that there are so many places in the world without easy access to clean water. The answer is never to privatize or ""modernize"" the water system of a place, as that is really just an excuse to implement political policies. It is just bizarre that our modern water systems in urban areas are so woefully lacking. Even desert areas of India get enough rainfall each year that a simple catchment system would solve all of a community's problems.",1
"Hundreds of people marched through the city, disrupting traffic and spray-painting graffiti. Authorities reported instances of vandalism and assault during a rally that organizers had billed as peaceful earlier in the day. In other parts of the country, spirited demonstrations on college campuses and peaceful marches along downtown streets have taken place since Wednesday. –– ADVERTISEMENT –– A mainly peaceful protest by about 3,000 people ended in Los Angeles early Saturday with about 200 arrests for failure to disperse after police broke up the lingering demonstration. Hundreds joined a Friday afternoon “love rally” in Washington Square Park in Manhattan.",1
It's truly awful anytime some sick minded individual decides to take the life of others for literally no reason other than just to do it. Arcan Cetin was believed to be the one who shot up a maul and killed numerous people. It really is alarming at what goes wrong in these people's lives that makes them do such thing.,1
"Wow, what a horrible and terrifying accident,I feel very bad for the people involved and their families. I wonder what caused this terrible accident, I hope that it was not any human error, because that makes it worse to deal with. I cannot imagine being on that train and the intensity of the accident. It makes me feelvery sad thinking about the deaths of those people on board.",1
"I always feel bad when women talk about their experiences with sexual assault because you know how I feel about that but I want to put it into words anyway. I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.",1
"Wow.. di you see this?  Delicia Taylor is suing the makers of this product.. Soft Sheen Carson Optimum Amly Legend No Mix, No Lye Relaxer.  She has bald spots, Burns, blisters and pain from using this.  Do you know anyone who uses this?  If you do have them check out this link.  The law suit is for 5 million dollars.. maybe they can get some money..  I think it's terrible that this product was allowed to be sold.  It is awful when someone thinks something would make them look nice but instead ends up damaging them for life.  Be sure to check the article out.. I think there are some pictures out there too. Brace yourself before you look at them.",1
"Reading about the issue of racism in this country brings to many various thoughts. The first of these being, truly, we cannot legislate thought itself. Either we champion free speech for those we find abhorrent, or we stop pretending to care about liberty. People will always suck. At a certain point, it seems we as a society have gotten a lot softer, even as life has become more comfortable. Racists are morons. Do I walk around stressed all day about racists? Hell no.",1
"Here we go again.  Another news report of another earthquake in Chile.  Fortunately this one apparently didn't cause any damage, but it was no slouch either at a magnitude 6.4.  Had the earthquake struck in a little different location, who know what might have happened.  This is the same place that got hit with an 8.8 a couple years ago.  Remember that one?  That was so sad.  It triggered a tsunami and 500 people were killed.  Not to mention the fact that there were 220,000 homes lost.  One piece of good news at least, since the 8.8 earthquake, they have put in a warning system for earthquakes and tsunamis.  Thank God for that.  That certainly can't prevent any earthquakes from happening, but at least maybe it will save some lives if, or should I say ""when"", the next earthquake occurs.",1
I think they should both be charged with murder. It's obvious at least one of them did it but I'm assuming both. It's crazy what this world has come to people just killing people all the time and usually for no reason. It's crazy and people need to be punished harsher. If you kill someone on person for no reason you should automatically get the death sentence.,1
"Corruption in corporations are an everyday occurrence. And it seems more and more the American workers are the victims of these erroneous fat cats. It's deplorable that the CEO gets away with corporate corruption and when the conscious of the workers come into play, they fire and ruin their lively hood. The corporations are in league with Washington due to the money trails. When the money is taken out of politics things will be better.",1
"I just read about a young male wolf that was shot dead after walking 700 miles in search of a mate. That seems pretty awful. I am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his journey, only to see it end in disaster. Apparently it was a government sniper that killed him. I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway. It seems dishonorable.",1
"Hey, so I just read about this fire in Arizona. It was not super serious and no one besides one person needed to go to the hospital. It was not like super tragic but it just makes me think about my own life. It also makes me really think about my living situation. I have never thought about how I live in an apartment building shared with several other people and that their actions could have severe consequences. For example, say someone above me has a child who is playing with the stove and the parents are unaware. I fire could start and all of that is beyond my control. It really freaks me out now that I know someone besides just myself could ruin my home or personal belongings. Even worse, someone could lose their life.",1
It's very upsetting to me that people feel they still need to poach elephants and rhinos just for their ivory. It's a species that you are making extinct here. Why are people not trying to control or help the situation more? There has to be some kind d of co trolling standards for the extinction of the rhino and elephant. I believe I saw something not that long ago that actually painted the tusks and got s of elephants and rhinos that permantely stained them so the poachers work not beable ti use the ivory. They stained them a pink or blue color. We should try and regulate that and do that so no one will kill these animals. If that's possible.,1
This is a very sad article. Being of of the first female fighter pilots must have given her and her family great honor. I think that there should be more training for all pilots who deal in these acrobatic flying routines. I also think that women have just as much of a right to become a fighter pilot as men.,1
"ABUJA, Nigeria ― After her father died two years ago during a Boko Haram raid on her village in Yobe, Nigeria, 16-year-old Zulyatu, her younger siblings and their mother fled to Biu, a town in northeast Nigeria’s Borno state. A year ago their mother left for another town to get treatment for high blood pressure from a traditional healer, leaving Zulyatu alone to care for her siblings, 12-year-old Abubakar and 8-year-old Amira.",1
"Hello there, I think this situation in Haiti needs our attention. It's clear that these people are suffering after such a catastrophe befell them. I urge you to donate and make a difference in these people's lives especially the children who are suffering and don't have anything to eat. Every dollar will count I think",1
"I thought this was a pretty interesting article. I learned some things about music and lawsuits. It might be relevant to some of what you and I were talking about some time ago. In any case, it has some new facts that have come to light, as it were, new information or opinions that I had not fully considered prior to reading this article.",1
of the 5000 rhinoceroses that remain free in the world have just killed one more. poachers do not respect endangered species. This enrages me and I try to hunt them. the 18-year-old rhinoceros left her baby orphaned. I really hope that stronger measures will be taken for the protection of these species and that their extinction will be avoided.,1
"Hello Friend how are you? How are your children behaving? I do not understand much about politics but now the President of this country and that of Ruisa joined forces when fighting against Syria. They called Syria as the first threat and classified it as terrorists. I really do not understand what is the reason for so much hearing and what was the initial problem.  I know that there are many good people in Syria, so it makes me think that many people died when the President of Russia bombed Syria. Many good people die. I consider that the war does not solve anything, it has not done it before and neither will it now.",1
I feel horrible that this is happening. It probably a lot to do with what America has done in that country. They are the ones who armed the rebels and caused this problem. America created the terrorists groups. I know I am not responsible but it makes me sick to know that intelligence agencies from our own countries instigated this problem. I feel sympathy for all those who have been killed and the families who's lives have been ruined.,1
I remember how hard I was to my mother especially in my teens.It can be rough and now I see that instead of how it use to be.As a kid you always think that you know what is best that you are number one.You don't really think about other people and their feelings and you tend to rebel and jsut be this horrible version of yourself.,1
"I just read another article about clashes over in the middle east and I am sending it over to you. This kind of thing has been going on forever ,,, my whole life and I have to admit that I am becoming immune to these types of stories and lost all empathy for these people. Normally you would read a story such as this and be heartbroken for the women and children who lost their lives but there is a story (or 2 or 3 or 10) like this every day and for decades and no end in sight. So just pile up the bodies of the woman and stack up the children murdered. Herd the maimed into a corner and block it all all of your concious. Too much insanity and too much gore to think about so the healthy thing for you do is just ignore these stories since there will a new one or two or ten tommorrow and forever",1
"Hey, I thought this was an interesting article about males born through medical fertilization. Apparently, these men are also more likely to suffer from the same problems as their fathers did with being able to have babies. It's sort of sad to think about it. The author suggest using a sperm donor instead, but I couldn't imagine doing that if I was in this situation.",1
"Aw, look, I didn't know Pete Burns died.  I'm glad he was happy with all his surgeries and his life, even if I wasn't.  He was so hot before he did all that, man. Gorgeous voice.  Why are all the pretty ones so often the wrong kind of crazy? Now I have to go listen to that song, or it's going to be stuck in my head all day.",1
The political divide in this country has only gotten worse over the years. Trump in particular has allow a rather nasty aspect of American society to rise to the surface and be open about their nastiness. This means that people on opposite political spectrum cannot see eye-to-eye at all. This makes compromise even worse and less likely to succeed.,1
"As someone who graduated with a STEM degree I know firsthand just how few women there are in the field. It's very sad, and it does indeed rob us of talent. All you have to do is look around to see how America is still a man-run country. The number of women in power is small, and women feel conflicted between what society says they should do and what they want to do. After all, many have aspirations besides raising kids. Who says that the 'house-mom' idea is right? The gender gap needs to close, and the wage gap. Women are not paid as much as men. That's a fact.",1
To all those with family members deployed in Iraq: God bless your military members who are currently trying to free Mosul from ISIS control. May they rescue and help those poor civilians that ISIS has taken as human shields. May both the US and Iraqi troops and those being held captive be kept safe.,1
"We need to make sure these brave people have more resources. Government needs to realize the value of animal tourism and do more to stop poaching. Once these precious animals are gone, there will be no bringing them back. We need to do more to make sure this does not happen. Poaching is a huge problem in Africa and penalties need to be severe",1
"My feelings and thoughts regarding the article I just read, is what I want to sit down and compose a brief message to you, in regards to it. I think that the Greenhouse Effect is highly over-rated. I find that the forces that oppose and are against it, has a strong point. As well, those in favor of it is also right, and just to want and seek and work towards ways that would be in the best interest of our lives and our environment. I believe it they would not show any interest, then whatever the harmful effects would only increase. Those in opposition, who feel that it's just an umbrella word to funnel monies in areas that are not needed. That believe Mother Nature and the natural state of how our Earth and it's environment works, are also somewhat correct. I wish each would meet halfway.",1
"Thomas referred the case to the full court, and shortly before midnight, the justices issued an order granting Arthur’s stay request. The order included a statement from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. explaining that while he did not believe this case merited a review from the Supreme Court, he had decided to vote for a stay anyway as a courtesy to his colleagues. Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution. While it takes five justices to overturn a lower court ruling, it takes only four to accept a case. “To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review, including these circumstances, I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy,” he wrote. Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito would have rejected the requ",1
"After reading an article about the fraud happened years ago, I am now traumatized with easily trusting people. It is indeed a nightmare for all the victims to be involved in this kind of problem. It is a challenge to trust people again and invest your money on something. It is always good to know your rights before giving away the so called ""trust"".",1
"It seems like the air pollution in India is getting worse and this is especially troubling for children who are very susceptible to the open air. This is very alarming as just recently 1,800 school had been close in India because of the poor air quality. It seem that these particle from the smog and fireworks are so tiny that they can make there way in the small pockets of the lungs.",1
"I just read this article about a forest land in Indonesia that could potentially be cut down and turned in to a tree plant. Normally an article like this might not attract my attention and cause me to read any further, but this particular forest land is home to the 3rd largest population of endangered orangutans and if the forest is cut down, it is estimated that 1750 orangutans will die or have to be rescued and re-homed. This is so heartbreaking to me because these are innocent animals, endangered ones at that, that are just living in their natural environment and have done nothing wrong. How can the government in Indonesia think that this idea is even a possibility, never mind the fact it could not possibly be a positive thing because of the negative impact it has on this species!!",1
"Food, water fears remain year after Brazil mine dam disaster — COLATINA, Brazil — One year after a dam ruptured and sent a giant wave of metal-laden mud gushing into one of Brazil’s most important rivers, people who live along the banks won’t drink the water and fishermen are afraid to eat their catch. Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife. In the river, more than 14 tons of fish died, mostly after mud got stuck in their gills. An equally large amount of aquatic plants die",1
"I've been reading about the drastic increase in migrants trying to get from Africa to Europe across the Mediterranean Sea.  This year has seen large amounts of people seeking refuge in Europe, and large increases in fatalities for those attempting the crossing.  These people are fleeing desperate conditions in hope of a better life and are attempting risky crossings because there are not enough safe ways to migrate.",1
Hey I feel like Trump winning was way worse than people thought. The amount of violent attacks on minorites and in general have increased considerably. There have been over 200 attacks since election day can you imagine that? I hate that trunp supporters somehow feel vindicated with their awful racism.,1
Another example of the Government disregard for the Indian people who lived here before we ever arrived. Sad in this day and age they are just trying to protect their land. Stop the potential for environmental damage to the land where they have lived for thousands of years. Don't we learn anything from history. How can they shot and harm these people just protecting their land and way of life.,1
"So apparently even turtles are poised to suffer from our careless destruction of the planet vis a vis degradation to habitats due to climate change. Though it seems like they will be able to withstand the changes in temperature, it is not at all clear what will be the outcome of the potentially lost habitats they live in due to climate change. These guys have been around longer than we have, as a species. It's really sad to think that we would be responsible for endangering them even further than we already have.",1
I can't believe that this place was ever given a license to carry out their business in the first place. These poor dogs died a slow painful death because the owners of this kennel were so careless. Did they not see the dogs suffering? How would they like to be locked up in a room in those temps? Make sure you are taking your pets to a reputable kennel if you do need to board them - I would have to see something like this happen to anyone else!!,1
"Sally Brampton: Journalist killed herself after 'missed opportunities' — Sally Brampton, founding editor of Elle magazine in the UK, killed herself after health professionals ""missed opportunities"" to offer her help, an inquest has heard.

Hastings Coroners' Court heard she was ""in crisis"" in March 2016 and had sought help from a psychiatrist and GP.",1
"Thinking about the refugee situation around the globe is so disheartening. There are so many people who are only trying to survive who cannot find support anywhere. Those of us in countries with resources really need to start pushing out legislators to accept and support these people, especially when their situations are the result of our own policies. Humans need to look out for each other far more--we should value every life the same, no matter the country of its origin.",1
"Dear friend ,  How are you ? I heard that you fell down the stairs and broke your leg !! Are you ok ? Hope you are getting better . But seriously, what really happened ? Your mum told me that you were running and fell  but I want to hear directly from you . I am coming to the hospital to visit you in an hour . That's my final decision. No one can change it , and yes because you didn't come to school today you missed a lot of work . Don't be too happy , you'll have to complete the work later",1
We should all try to do more to decrease global warming for the sake the polar bear population and for our own human population as well. Please read this article about the polar bears and the problems they face and issues that they must endure related to global warming. The article is very descriptive and explains the issues very well. It is worth reading and sharing with others to  bring exposure to the plight of the polar bears.,1
Its so obvious how much lady  periods and pills we have to take are linked to our depresstion and body pains. The chemistry going on in our body is somthing I cant even get ahold of. The pill though is such a thing we need if we dont want to have babies that this time. The after math of it is just a deeper conversation we have to understand so that we dont end of hurting ourself.,1
"How can Canada think that was the right course of action? Of course we are no better with how we treated the Native Americans. These poor kids are ripped from their homes and subjected to such horrors because of who they are. It is sickening. It is as if we have no respect for the past. Who cares if they didn't speak the language or assimilate into ""normal culture"". Is that any reason to destroy their lives? No apology could ever fix what was done. So many children died, just because they were born into the ""wrong"" culture. This mentality, unfortunately, isn't isolated or gone from planet. We are destroying the identity of people who for the most part probably just wanted to live and die without interfering with the ""new"" culture. Is it so wrong to be different?",1
"We need to recognize that global warming is real and acknowledge our part in it. We as a globe need to take note and work together. The Great Barrier Reef is one of our planet's more amazing wonders and we need to do all we can to protect it, while the Amazon isn't doing absolutely fantastic we've improved the quality and conservation.",1
"This is a sad article. Some many things are unknown for those born outside the country. It is always unfair that others are able to get deported after spending most of their lives in the USA, especially those that came at a very early age.

Did you hear about the horrible earthquake in New Zealand? IT was devastating and I am so heartbroken and sad for all of those people.It's going to be difficult to get aid to some places because the roads are severely damaged. Those people must be so terrified and worried. I'm sure they're hungry and in serious need of water and food and many are in need of shelter. I pray that God gives them all peace and comfort during this time.,1
Did you hear about the earthquake in Tanzania? There were over 200 deaths. It's so scary because you can't really prepare for something like that. I live in California so people are always warning us about the san andres fault line. I get so worried thinking about how bad it might get if something like that happens to us.,1
"I just heard that the Editor of Elle magazine killed herself.  It is always sad when someone take their own life. What makes this one worse than the usual is that there were chances that she could have been helped but she was turned away. They said that she was ""over the worst of it"" but other evidence suggests that she was not. To me it seems like people did not want to deal with her for some reason or they were on a small budget and could not afford to treat her so they turned her away. Very sad and very messed up that you turn away someone whop wants helpa dn they then kill themselves. The system needs to be fixed.",1
Remember that you where telling me about how you were having trouble sleeping lately?  Maybe you should take a look at this article that I found online about sleep paralysis and what it is all about and how it is affecting this guy.  I hope that it can help you out a little bit with what you have been going through.,1
"Wow. So sad to see yet another species on the way to extinction. It's crazy to think that there's only 60 of one species left in the world. I know that it was the same way with the white rhino - it was like we knew it was coming, but we were completely unable to stop it, because it was just too late. I wonder if they could keep them in captivity.",1
"These are the headlines that I have to read these days! I just can't believe all of the horrid news that is taking over our lives lately. And now we have to worry about when our men and women go out to train, that this kind of thing can end of happening at the drop of a hat. So, who is responsible after this? Who helps the children now without parents? Who pays for everything surrounding their funerals, and all of the costs after that?",1
"A perfect example of greed and selfishness-British government is willing to kill innocent creatures in order to drill for oil, regardless of consequences! Instead of exploring other alternatives, such as natural energy sources, they will go and march their way to Africa and claim innocent lives just to put money in their pockets. I wonder if the majesty Queen, the mighty Queen of England, would appreciate of someone suddenly marched into her palace and started drilling for oil?!!! Absolutely disturbing-total disregard for nature and living creatures, nothing but pure greed regardless of the cost!",1
"You know I'm not a fan of religion in any context, but this type of thing happens everywhere. There's always some idiot who goes off and uses religion, bigotry, sex, gender, anything really as an explanation. It's sad that you read something like this and it doesn't even feel like news. Perhaps its just our access that's making this seem ordinary.",1
the war on terror that began with the initial war of America on Afghanistan for the purpose of eliminating Talibaan and restoring order and democracy there but this war has continue for quite some time and has turned the country in ruined . i think its about time we leave that country for good and let them live there life,1
"The only solution for the ""wage gap"" is the total abolishment of capitalism and all governments. There will be no more wage gap when there is no money! By instituting Anarcho-Communism, all people can be given what they need without a worry of who is getting more or less. Capitalism is evil and must be destroyed!",1
"I have pretty strong thoughts and feelings about this. From what I read, I feel like that is a very tragic situation. Us as a society, we are taking advantage of the trees we have here. In order to protect the environment and make the environment better again, we need to take care of it. What we are doing, in my opinion, is morally and ethnically wrong and we need to do a better job of taking care of nature. I understand that some blame is from the volcanoes of hawaii, but feel like us humans do way more damage than what mother nature brings.",1
"I think the situation in allepo is really dire. I don't understand why the syrian government is trying to harm the people there whey they didn't do anything wrong. I think the whole situation is really sad and that a lot of innocent people are getting hurt for no reason. War is awful and I hope that there's a solution to it soon. I'm glad that the UN is trying to do something, but I just don't think that it's enough.",1
"Hello, dear group. Let's trust in the laws of our country and in truly just judgments. Hopefully the murderer accused of five counts of murder will not be free and quiet in the streets of this country. I hope that justice can compensate a little to the relatives of the victim. After a 24-hour chase the police found the criminal and even though the victims have not been recognized, they will soon discover who they are.",1
"It really is too bad that this had to happen.  The internet will never let them forget.  I'm sure the zookeepers feel awful about what has transpired.  After all, They are probably all great lovers of animals and you and I know that it is never easy to see a poor animal die.  I wonder if there were things to be done that could have prevented this or if I am just thinking with insight.",1
It brings me great sorrow to tell you about a horrific incident that left two children without parents after a mechanical failure at an amusement park. It is truly shocking and disturbing that this could have happened. Thee two kids lsot both parents and they watched them drown which is disturbing to think about.,1
There is people starving and going without any food. Some of these people used to have jobs and ate well before they fell on bad times. They are suffering and going without basic nessicities. One mother went as far as trying to boil grass for her children to eat. I cant imagine lacking so much nutrition and suffering so bad,1
"I think it's a shame that they made the employees create fake accounts in order to drive up the sales. What a shame. Why are they blaming the employees when it was those in higher positions who were forced into doing what they did. If they wasn't forced then it never would've happened. I feel sorry for the worker, but I would've quit before they had me do something fraudulent.",1
"Oh man, I feel perturbed. Why do people have to keep suffering and dying so we can understand that strict gun control is necessary, who needs to die? How many people? This is just a sad and crazy story repeating itself, over and over again. We need to understand that as long as anyone can get a gun, nobody is safe.",1
"People who take advantage of and endanger animals are the worst criminals in existence. Animals are defenseless and unable to do anything other than be confined and taken advantage of. This article shows the unfortunate process after animals are confiscated and taken away from these dangerous people, but there is no global consensus on the proper sequence and handling of these animals.",1
"I am really touched by this story. the rescue just restored my faith in humanity.The success of the rescue operation proves that extraordinary things can be achieved with passion and determination. human conflict causes suffering to both human beings and animals. Suffering animals should not be forgotten or overlooked, even in the midst of human conflicts or natural or man-made disasters. I was very touched and encouraged by these acts of bravery and care towards animals.",1
"This is horribly to read about. The sheer number of people dying every day, just trying to escape on boats, is quite alarming. Think about people from one country equaling those people dying in gang violence in major, crime ridden societies - but JUST for people attempting to escape via water. What should we do about this? Open our borders? Is it enough to simply help them get out of where they are to some place safer? Obviously this isnt exacly their fault, especially the kids. But what can we do? Will money help? Probably not. Open borders will. Bring them here and help them find a more peaceful way through thehri own lives.",1
"Hey B, remember that conversation we had the other day, well I found an article that talks about it.  It basically says that humans have destroyed 10 percent of Earth's wilderness in the last 25 years.  The article said that the total land area is about half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of the whole state of Alaska.  That is about 1.3 million square miles of wilderness, that just disappeared.  The article also revealed that humanity has one to two decades more to turn it around before it is too late.  I hope something is done soon and I'll send you a link to the article.",1
It must be extremely difficult to find these lone wolf terrorist. I can only begin to understand the type of manpower needed to pursue these people. I think that most of them are mentally ill and hard to catch before they commit the crime. It makes me think of the movie Minority Report and how that type of technology might become available with the advance of A.I..,1
"I was reading an article about poachers killing off many elephants because of the ivory trade. One part that stuck in my mind is that in one country, the elephants are protected more than they are in the neighboring country. It is odd that an elephant can literally walk away from its protection by wandering into the neighboring country. I was not aware of any of this. The article somewhat jokingly said that elephants do not have passports.",1
"Bankia a banking company in Spain had their board members spend unauthorized private money from the bank on hotels, entertainment food, and other luxuries. All this was spent from credit cards used by the bank itself. The spending was unauthorized and not reported to the tax authorities at all. Bankia was already in the limelight already due to being bailed out by the government in 13 million dollars.",1
"Can you believe this article? The more I read this article the more disgusted I got with what had been done to this kitten. This is a awful story that deserves to be heard by more people to make sure that the the kitten receives justice, and that the person who did this is not allowed to hurt any more animals. I think it is a great thing that this person is not allowing for someone to get away with this and making sure that others will stand with him and not allow this crime to go unpunished. I think it would be great if you could share this story and let others know so something like this can be stopped in the future.",1
I feel bad for the Queen.  She just lost her husband and now she's sick. I also feel bad for the people over there.  They've had rulers as leaders for so long that most of the weren't even alive to experience anybody else.  I hope she recovers and is able to get a few more good years out of her life.,1
"this article was very interesting because it talks on how climate change can have influenced the extinction of the melomys in theyre habitat. it talks alot about it and basically lets us know that climate change wasnt the cause of extinction and that us, humans could have prevented this  from happenning but just decided not to.",1
"This was terrible! I'm so glad that those guys got arrested. It's never okay to throw bottles at people, I don't care who you are or what the circumstances are. That poor kid almost died. I mean why? For nothing. Because of a stupid fan rivalry? What do you guys think? Agree or disagree? I can't see how you could take a different stance on it, but just for kicks and giggles. I mean I'm all for sports and stuff but if you get out of control and you hurt someone, that's on you. This is supposed to be fun. These games aren't supposed to be violent, and continued behavior along these lines could damage the reputation of the game, the fans, and the organization. I don't condone it at all and I don't think that you should either. So there you go, that's that. There you go. That's that. There.",1
"The article says that- Trump to supporters harassing minorities: 'Stop it' — Donald Trump on Sunday told his supporters to stop harassing minorities, in his first televised sit-down interview since becoming President-elect. ""I am so saddened to hear that,"" Trump told CBS' Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"" when she said Latinos and Muslims are facing harassment. ""And I say, 'Stop it.' If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'"" Trump directed his comments to his own supporters whom said have written racist slogans or chanted degrading messages -- particularly in schools. It was a powerful appeal to a nation ripped apart by the divisive 2016 campaign. Trump's election has left Democrats angry and many minorities fearful about the future.",1
"I just read about this Australian hiker that was lost in the Malaysian jungle for two weeks and most of that time without food. He was week but he survived. I'm shocked. I'm happy he made it because to often you hear those stories of a lost hiker and it ends tragically. His friends and family say he has a strong mental attitude, he must. I don't think I'd ever survive that long especially since I don't even know anything about safe plants to eat like this guy must have. Way to go sir. Way to fight.",1
"I am writing to you in response to an article I just read about Nevada and the water supply. It is of a truth, as the article points out that the news media primarily only follows what happens in California, and not Nevada. Which is the driest State, and in need of attention and assistance. I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results. However the present state is also causing more abuse factors in the family.",1
"‘Silicon Valley’ stars recount being harassed by Donald Trump supporters — “Silicon Valley” stars Kumail Nanjiani and Thomas Middleditch both took to Twitter Saturday morning to recount their experience being harassed by two Donald Trump supporters in a Los Angeles bar. “Was at a bar last night with @Middleditch. At the end of the night, 2 white dudes, 20’s, who’d been there for hours came up to us,” Nanjiani began, adding that they said they were fans, but thought they were “wrong about Trump.” “I go ‘Hey we don’t wanna discuss politics right now.’ His friends goes ‘oh they’re cucks.’",1
"More toddlers and preschoolers are overdosing on opioids — In recent years, rates of toddlers and preschoolers hospitalized for opioid overdoses more than doubled, according to a new study. In fact, overdoses rose more than 100% over a 16-year period among all children, the study published in JAMA Pediatrics Oct. 31 showed. Researchers from Yale School of Medicine analyzed national data from the Kids’ Inpatient Database on children admitted to U.S. hospitals for opioid poisoning. The study focused on more than 13,000 records from patients ages 1 to 19 between 1997 to 2012. What's to blame? Possibly the increase of prescribed pain killers, including OxyContin and Vicodin. Research from 1999 to 2010 show retail sales of prescription opioids quadrupled.""Even in children younger than 6 years,",1

"Hey, remember that eighties song ""You Spin me Right Round"" that people like to laugh about? The guy responsible for that just dies recently, he seemed like he was pretty interesting. I heard that he was on the UK version of Celebrity Big Brother, but I bet that show is just as boring as the American version. It's so interesting how the celebrity culture over there compares to over here.",1
"Erving Goffman, a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.",1
"Ugh! I am literally sick to my stomach about all of these attacks. It's utter nonsense about how many people have been killed and for what?! Stupid preferences on what a someone believes a society should consist of?! It is disgusting. My heart really goes out to all those families and the doctors! Those doctors are tirelessly working to heal as many people they can and even by a dim light since the conditions around them are being torn to shreds. The amount of bravery to try so hard and keep the number of people dying as low as possible is amazing, to say the least. I really feel sad for the familes that have lost so many loved ones and that have been displaced.",1
"So sad. Why is it that the social media giants can quickly shut down conservative speech, but cannot get a handle on these ""suicide groups""? Mental health needs to be taken more seriously in this country or any country. With mental health not covered by a lot of insurance policies, suicide and depression will continue to be problems. I feel for these kids. I know what it feels like to feel depressed and hopeless. But anyone that preys on kids in these conditions needs to go to jail. It infuriates me.",1
"Hey, I was just reading an article about that house fire that happened in WV. Can you imagine the tragedy? That is such a horrible way to die.  And to think that two of the victims were children plus their dog. It makes me ill just thinking about it.  Such a huge loss for that family and the community. I hope officials find out soon what caused it and I pray for the friends and family of those who were killed. So sad!",1
"This article is extremely sad for the State of Louisiana. Not only has the state been ravaged by floods leading to the damage of both homes and businesses, but now the economy is being further devastated by the exodus of individuals and population erosion from pre-Katrina years. The state needs an injection of capital to help individuals and small businesses get their feet back underneath them, and providing the foundation of the local economies to not only sustain themselves and thrive.",1
I am one for not giving your potential mate any reasonable doubt. For example if Tanaka (Mariah Carey's backup dancer) made her fiance uncomfortable he should have been axed in the beginning of the relationship. I also do not think it supports security all the time either. I think that if you  value that mate there should definitely be sacrifices made in regards with relationships.,1
"Well, I totally understand the people to make a deliberate choice of not having children. It is such physically and emotionally charged task. I would say it is impossible to do it right. Infants, middle schoolers, high schoolers… It is not easy for kids to be kids, to depend on parents who are also struggle with their problems and issues. The issues of communication, balancing, keeping priorities are especially importance in the relationships with your middle school children: it is critical time to form your lifelong relationship with them and, probably, it is one of the most challenging period.",1
This is just one of the negative consequences of long term war in a region.  The hospitals in Yemen have been devastated by war and no diseases are starting to spread among the population with no way to control them without outside help.  I hope the people of Yemen will be able to find humanitarian aid soon to help them control the spread of disease.,1

"This is really sad!  I would think there would be a way to stop this from happening.  Everyone knows this is being done, so why couldn't they stop it.  The human traffiking is a sad thing and to have them all dying try to get to another place is sad.There must be some kind of policing that could be done wherever the people are boarding these boats.",1
"It saddens me to think about a young rino passing away. I can not help but question the circumstances surrounding its death. My heart goes out to the person who worked hard to try to save its life and is grieving over the loss of that hard battle. As a wildlife rehabilitator I know the struggle all too well. I understand how it feels to forgo sleep and food because you are working to save an animal. It is painful. But if you can save even one, it will make it all worth it in the end.",1

"We should cherish all the works that the police force offers to us each and every day.

"I think issues like basic income, universal healthcare, and right to assisted dying are way more important. My interest in being fit or healthy is the reduction of painful symptoms. When I eat sugar, carbs, and enriched flour foods, my legs hurt, my back hurts, my stomach digestion goes very bad, and I get heartburn. For me, it's not so much about being fat or not, it's about reducing pain.",1
it's dissapointing that in this day and age that homosexuality is still illegal in different countries. I would think that it would be past that and that people would just get over it. It took forever for America to recognize gay marriage so I guess it's not surprising that Uganda hasn't yet. But I still think that it's a breach of human rights and it's moraly wrong,1
"I had no idea Shannen Doherty was going through breast cancer. It is such a tough situation to experience. Cancer really does humble the soul into new places that one never thought possible to emerge stronger from feeling. It sounds like she faced it with a mask of strength at first. After time, the real emotions came through where she realized the strength was not in being stoic but admitting how tough it really is to experience. It is through supposed weakness that we become stronger.",1
"Being able to get out of contracts for timeshares sounds like quite a nightmare.

Friends and family - we need to pray for those people in Taiwan.  They have just been hit by yet antoher hurricane.  This has left their country in quite the run down state.  People are heavily effected in this country and need our thoughts and prayers.  We also need to pray for China due to the hurricane heading there next.,1
"The story about what is going on currently in Venezuela is devastating. It is almost haunting and definitely disturbing. The economic crisis that is happening there is not only affecting people, but also the animals that live there. Especially in the zoos. We don't often let how a crisis in countries can affect animals cross our minds, we typically only think of the people. Not only is directly affecting the animals in the way that they are being fed diets that are drastically different from they should be consuming, but the people there are having to hunt animals that we would not typically deem acceptable. Such as cats, and dogs, and even going as far as to steal horses from racetracks simply to eat them, or to feed them to animals at the local zoos. Many animals have suffered for weeks.",1
"When is the world going to realize that they need to start charging bullies with murder when kids kill themselves? Seriously, if you torture someone emotionally, how is that different from doing it physically? It's not. You're doing an insane amount of damage to someone's psyche, enough for them to commit suicide. Prosecute the kids bullying as adults, and start punishing these kids harshly enough to deter them from doing it ever again. Any adults aware and ignoring it? Charge them as accomplices to murder.",1
"It's amazing how much destruction two large warring nations can do to such a smaller nation. The Middle East was never in a position of power, they have been fighting for a millenia, but the destruction is much greater now, there has never been weaponry so large and crushing to such a small state nation. It's unbelievable that an entire generation of culture will be separated from their families and can only take what they have learned so far.",1
"I don't know how they do it. They get abused in their own country, then abused by orgs that are supposed to help. I simply don't know why they would want to live. They are very strong. No org HAS to help them but if they sign up to help- then help. I think some are doing the best they can to help. However- more has to be done- Animals can't be left this way, so why can people?",1
What I learned about this situation was that sometimes life is not fair. Seeing this boy trapped in a place for 4 days is terrible. His poor body tried to survive and grab on for dear life but children are not exempt from this life. To think about that kid in that positiion makes me sad. His family is the one that suffers unfortunately.,1
The results of the fire could have been worse. I'm just glad nobody died.  Stuff can always be replaced.  Burns are the worst since they're so painful.  Hopefully these people have some family they can stay with until they're able to find a new housing situation. That's great that the firemen were able to get the fire under control so quickly.,1
"Hey, this article really shows how people can be compassionate in even the hardest places to do so. It's really an inspiring thing for them to do to go in and save these animals even in the midst of an ongoing conflict where they could have come to harm, as well as the animals. Also important is the situation in Gaza, and other conflict zones, makes it rather difficult to maintain a humanely run zoo, and have veterinarians on hand in case the animals become ill.",1
It's one thing to kill another person with a motive. But who kills horses and animals?! They are completely innocent creatures. God we have used and abused these animals for centuries. I have no idea what kind of motive this killer has. These horses deserve so much more. It's almost worse than murder in my opinion. I really hope this guy gets caught.,1
"Here is an article I just read about an accident at an amusement park in Australia. I've never heard of Dreamworld, have you? But the ride sounds like the old Shoot the Rapids we used to ride on at Cedar Point. In this case, the boat tipped over and people got trapped in the conveyor belt. I can't even imagine what the last moment of those people's lives must have been like. As for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no words! At least none of the children died in the accident. But now they have lost a parent. One of those kids was just a baby. Now she will never know her mother. I never thought about rides failing when we were kids and used to go to amusement parks, but now I would probably not ride on any of that stuff.",1
Reading this article makes me upset. I hate what we do to native people. It seems as a society we seem to ignore their feelings and traditions just to move ourselves forward. We forget that we intruded onto their land to make ourselves homes that we enjoy yet we can't offer them the same good feeling. To even think that the option of having dangerous amounts of mercury seep into the waters is beyond me.,1
"This article greatly disturbs me. The fact that we treat Muslims and people of their culture like dogs and terrorist is disgusting and wrong both morally and ethically. The way they are being shown on tv and media is wrong and horrible. Our president thinks that if we ban muslims from the country, all of a sudden our nation is safe. When the fact of the matter is, most shootings that happen in this country, are from Caucasians. Muslims are shown in bad light due to some extremist and they do not deserve this treatment.",1
"Just when you think you have heard enough crazy Donald Trump stories this one takes the cake. I just read about a mother from Fresno Texas who not only kicked her elementary son out of the house for voting in a mock school election for Donald Trump she also videotaped it. Well, of course, the video went viral. The Fort Bend County Texas sheriff's department went to check out the situation and the child seemed to be in good health. The mother made the child stand on the street corner with a sign telling why he was kicked out of the house. The mother claims now that it was only a joke. I hope the child is not permanently scarred from this incident.",1
"it was a very gruesome moment it doesn't help the fact that refugees face an exhaustive screening process by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that can take years. it is good that when  The federal government and its nonprofit partners provide job-search help and cash assistance for refugees during their first months in the United States. After that, they are largely on their own.  This strategy has made it hard for refugee families—who often come to America with few assets or material possessions—to move up and out of poverty, and may be contribute to younger generations’ sense of isolation, the result of struggling to find their place in this country. Now, earning a living in the U.S. is proving difficult for younger generations. Donald Trump’s crusade against immigrants",1
"Hey T, I found an article that I thought you would be interested in.  It is about how Iraqis found evidence of torture by Islanic State in mass graves near the city Mosul.  Can you believe that, they literally just killed and dumped bodies there.  From what the articles says in just one hours time they found 20 to 25 bodies.  Some where hard to even tell if it were human or not.  They still can't figure out how they died but they will soon enough.  Though from the state of decomposition it has only been a few weeks that they have been there. All I can say is that were tortured point blank.",1
"Man that's tough to read- I remember watching those events unfold and just being absolutely miserable and horrified over it. I remember hearing that they were killing hostages one by one on the news, and just bursting into tears at that point. This article really vividly reminded me of that moment, it's really sad.",1
It is very sad to know Robert died. He was a great actor. You never now when your time is going to come. I get very worried of my own health. There are so many sicknesses and diseases. I tried to get checked annually at the doctors. I hope they come out with a cure for these diseases and sicknesses. I feel like Robert did live kind of a long life. Robert has made good memories and I think that is very important when living . I want to make a lot of good memories now that I'm alive. Everyones life should have meaning just like Robert's.,1
"You know I have no sympathy for anyone who harms an animal. I'm a huge animal rights advocate and I think those who are cruel to animals deserve very strict punishment. The officer involved should be charged with a crime and fired from their job. I hate it when people hurt defenseless animals and this particular crime did not have to happen! When this happens with children being left in hot cars, there are serious charges leveled and so, there should be the same in this case!",1
I just read about a company is threatening one of the largest populations of Orangutan's in Indonesia by chopping down a critical forest to convert it to a tree plantation.  I think it's really disgusting that Indonesia knows they need to preserve their land and wild life but still allows things like this to happen.,1
Global warming is an issue that has been brewing for some time and seems to be getting torn in all directions as it is not a grey issue but a black and white issue meaning it is either happening or it is not. It is hard to see which side has the more valid argument over the other since everyone involved is so passionate about their side of it all.,1
I read this article about a bus that was hit a random car from out of nowhere. The bus was parked and the car just plowed into it. It's kind of fucked up but typical. A few people were hospitalized but no one died. Anyways their investigating the crash. These types of incidents happen so often I'm rather numb to their effects.,1
"It is very tragic to hear this news regarding the circumstances that many animals are facing in various zoos across the globe. It seems that human nature is causing these animals to be subjected to lives they shouldn't have to endure. If they were released into nature then maybe they would have a fighting chance but at the same time, most of them have been raised in the zoo perhaps so their ""social skills"" in nature may be quite the detriment as well. I just wish that some organization(s) could rescue them and take care of them the way they ought to be. No animal should really have to live in a zoo, to begin with, and now they are suffering from malnourishment and lack of care. It is tragic to read about this but it is the world in which we live.",1
"The officer whose car had been hit approached Ms Rader to find she had an ""unclasped brassiere"" and was trying to put on her blouse, police said.The freshman told the officer that she had been driving back to her residence on campus.The arresting officer wrote in an affidavit: ""I asked her why she was not dressed while driving and she stated she was taking a Snapchat photo to send to her boyfriend while she was at a red light.""She was arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated and released from jail on Thursday morning on a $2,000 (£1,600) bail bond, police said.",1
"I just read about Arnold Palmer dying. He was a fixture on Sunday afternoons watching golf. I really wish that he was still around, I will miss him out on the course. He has always been around since I was a kid, even when he quit playing he would be out there for the major championships. I think it will be different watching them without him around. He was a genuinely nice man.",1
Did you finally see what happened to that sicko that stole all of those nude photos from those celebrities? Those poor people got tricked into getting their photos stolen and this man went and was showing them to everyone. He finally was convicted of this and it serves him right. What an idiot. Just remember you don't ever take any photos like this and never upload them even if you did. Keep this stuff private and off of the internet. I sure am glad this guy finally got what was coming to him.,1
Hey buddy. Did you hear about this weird disease that is spreading amongst the frog population? Apparently it's a disease that happens due to people having ponds in their house. I worry what this disease could do to the local population of frogs. Tell anyone who has a pond to becareful with what they are moving in and out of their ponds.,1
"Did you see where there was a buss crash on the highway this morning? I don't think anyone got badly hurt, but it just shows you how quickly things can go from good to bad. I hope the one at fault wasn't doing something stupid like texting while they were driving! I can't stand those people! Well, however it happened, I'm just glad no one was seriously hurt or killed.",1
"Hey, I just read this insane article about the situation in Aleppo. I didn't even realize how bad it was. People are dying and have no hope for the future. It really makes me appreciate everything I have in life and the article makes all my problems seem so trivial and insignificant by comparison. Anyway, you should check it out.",1
"Well, this is frustrating. Not only will the new law not really help, but it doesn't sound like anything will help. It's a good point, about having to get the fishers on board with saving the paquita, but I don't know how to convince them. If it came down to feeding my family or saving a handful of dolphins that are probably going to die out anyway, there's a good chance I'd pick my family.  The story's a year or two old -- so once I've finished doing what I'm doing, I'm going to look up the paquita and see what's happened since then.",1
I found this article and thought you might be interested in it. This is so sad and disgusting. Gun violence really must be stopped in this country and it's hurting innocent people and even unborn people around this country. I think there might be a die in we can participate in happening this week if you can come.,1
"I never knew that bananas were at risk of becoming extinct. Apparently we need to cultivate more varieties, so we do not face another crisis like Cavendish and Big Mike bananas that have succumbed to a fungal disease and almost got wiped out. We are so used to seeing bananas as a common fruit at supermarkets that we never think of not ever eating another one again! I found this article very intriguing, there is so much work that goes into figuring out how to protect this yellow fruit from fungal illnesses and make it more resistant to various dangerous fungal strains.Apparently this presents a great challenge for the scientists but they are hoping to cultivate more banana plant varieties that will be more resistant to various illness.",1
"hello friend, how have you been lately, I am somewhat depressed by an article that I read recently, that helped me a lot, that I realized that the article had a problem that interested me more, because of the events that were happening in this, for example: He did not vaccinate or treat his cattle due to illness; he does not use cowboys to control them and cope; does not manage or control the reproduction",1
"Can you believe how disturbed some people are? I just read an article about a woman whose parents forced her to have sex with both of them when she was 11. They did it for money. If you are a parent struggling for money, how in the world does your mind turn to sexually abusing your child for money? They are sick, and 20 years is not enough time for them in prison. They are the people that are supposed to protect her, and they violated her in the worst way. She is very brave for telling her story and for just being a survivor.",1
"he mayor was on Duterte's list of local officials branded as ""narco-politicians"" who allegedly have ties to the illegal drug world, according to CNN affiliate CNN Philippines. He, along with his wife, surrendered themselves to provincial police in August to clear their names and deny involvement. At the roadblock early Friday morning, an ""armed encounter"" between Dimaukom's men and police ensued, the report says, with law enforcement officials responding to fire from the mayor's bodyguards, leaving 10 men dead. Duterte was elected to office in May on a platform of a hardline crackdown on crime, particularly illegal drugs. Since taking office in early June, his police force has waged a bloody war on drug dealers and users, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Filipino drug suspects at the",1
It a tragedy when the people who are their to protect and serve us are gun down for no reason. My heart goes out to both families in this situation. It totally is unfair to die for no reason because of a selfish and ill man. It is really upsetting that this man just decides to kill police officers that are on duty to protect us from danger.,1
"I think lung cancer is not really caused too highly by air pollution. I feel that the number one pollutants that cause lung cancer is purely smoking.  Im glad I quit smoking years ago.  They say these scientific reports and studies provide that the air pollution caused early stage lung cancers, however I really just don't believe it.",1
I really hate ISIS. They are the scum of the earth. I just learned that they killed over 100 Iraqi police officers in Mosul. This is the kind of thing that happens when we pull our troops out of Iraq. Yeah we should not have been there in the first place but we made that mistake and we now have to take responsibilty for it. I feel so bad for all the Iraqi people who just want to live their lives in peace.,1
Did you hear about the polar bear name Pizza called the word's saddest polar bear? Apparently they are not treating it well in China by not giving it enough space and turning his life into a circus show. He started to inflict self harm because of his living condition. I really hope China comes up with better animal cruelty laws although I doubt this will happen because of our culture difference. It makes me furious knowing animals are being treated like this over there.,1
"Other story similar to the local news about the killing of a woman I know in town. It always makes me think of the children first. It also makes me wonder how a person could commit such atrocities, especially in front of children. The child that called 911 will no doubt mentally live with that phone call for the rest of their life.  Article seem to have been murder, and a middle class home, maybe drug use or robbery gone wrong? What is wrong with the world today? I will certainly hug my children tighter tonight after reading all these articles about murder, grieving children, deaths, worldly disasters and sadness. The world is such an interesting, wonderful yet sad place all at once. I will also say a prayer for those kids and pray and be thankful for mine.",1
"We need to recognize that global warming is real and acknowledge our part in it. We as a globe need to take note and work together.

the phone lines from the suicide prevention line surged after the election.  it also climbed when robin williams committed suciide.  thankfully there is this prevention line to help those in need who have sucidal thoughts but we need to condition people that committing sucide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem,1
"Another Taliban attack in Afghanistan today, this time directed against the Germans. A few dead and many wounded, primarily women and children. They said it was in retaliation against US air strikes that have cause a lot of civilian casualties. An endless cycle, just like before. Remind me again why we're there.",1
It is awful that there is such turmoil in the Middle East. It makes me so grateful that I am an American. Isn't it sad that Doctors Without Borders is at risk because of the fighting in the Middle East. Those people donate their time to help others and they have to worry if they are going to be hurt or killed. Such a sad area of the world.,1
"I just read an article about two US Military personals being shot in Jordan. I have so many emotions running through me. I am sad about the loss of lives. I am in disbelief. How could this happen? The article said they do not believe it was a terrosit attack so that makes me feel relieved, but still worried. US is there to assist Jordan for training. Why our are people being attacked?! The article said they failed to stop at the entrance so I do not know if maybe it was a miscommunication. I am confused to what actually happened. From what I read there was an attack on Jordan when they just drove and barralled through their border so they are on high alert. My heart goes out to all of those involved and I am sad. But why on earth would they think that the US military personal are planning",1
A Russian twelve year old left for school one morning. Her mother went looking for her when she didn't return home. When she called her cell phone she was told that her daughter had committed suicide as a part of some social group that takes their own lives. It's sad to see kids seeking attention in this light.,1
"In Iraq, Islamic State militants are kidnapping thousands of people at gunpoint to use as shields against the U.S. takeover as the militants move to their last stronghold of Mosul.   This is something that complicates the U.S. airstrikes because it is not certain how many civilians might be injured or killed since they are being used as shields by the militants.   As the militants are squeezed tighter and tighter together in their last stronghold, more and more villages are suffering, entire villages of people are being taken and used as these shields.   It is a terrible situation and I cannot imagine the suffering as people are missing and lost forever from families and leaving many children as orphans.",1
"This sounds like a horrible accident. I can't even imagine what that family is going through. The ones that were involved in the accident but survived probably saw some horrible things, and those kids who witnessed their mother die. As a parent myself that's a terrifying thought I would never want my son to go through something like that.",1
"the eldest generation of russians aren't being treated properly and should have some sort of financial compensation.  they are living off very little per day financially and live in poor conditions.  after paying utilities, they barely have enough for food.  health care has also taken a turn for the worse because they can't afford to get proper health treatment due to the costs involved",1
"You should check out this article. As I was reading I was happy that the injuries were not worse tha n they were. Could you imagine being in any sort of situation like this? It makes me feel bad for people with children, could you imagine letting you r children leave every day and not knowing what could happen to them?",1
"I just read an article about numerous female athletes that of taking the world by storm. I love hearing about female athletes, however it was frustrating to read an article with so many typos, miss spellings, errors and words that didn’t make sense put together. The article was clearly not proof read before being published where I read it. For such an important topic, proofreading would have been easy.",1

Moore also says Democrats must fire the pundits, pollsters, and members of the media who refused to let go of a narrative about the election that proved to be incorrect, force aside any Democratic members of Congress who aren't ready to fight, and remind everyone they meet that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. His No. 4 item, however, might come as a surprise to Democrats who are posting their own status updates on social media about how ""shocked"" or ""stunned"" they are at this outco",1
I thought the article was quite sad to read and disheartening to hear about the Iraqi people. I felt sad for them knowing their future was uncertain and how hard it was to find a job. The economy they deal with is much worse than ours and I can only imagine how difficult it must be living there. I hope that it gets better in the future.,1
There are a lot of older people in Russia who survived the Second World War who are now trying their best to survive.  Many estimates say that there are a lot of people in Russia who survived only on $4.50 a day.  With this little money they do not have the luxury of going out to eat.  Also when living on so little money it is dangerous because of Health Care problems.  If one has to  have surgery or even get expensive medication it can be a real setback to their life style.  I hope the Russian economy becomes better enough to support  it's elderly and everyone else in the country.,1
I just read an article about the attacks in a syrian town. It sounds horrible what they are going through. It talks about women and children dying. I tried to immagine what it would be like to live in such horror. It mentions many post on social media of pictures and videos. I would be interested in seeing some of the pictures and videos of this violence. Reading stuff like this really makes you appreciate being in America.,1
Hey man did you hear about this Palm Oil Company is trying to threaten to take down the worlds third largest Orangutan populations? This is pretty upsetting for me as I am in love with these animals. They are wanting to cut down most of the forest. This place is in Indonesia and this company is also planning on building a drainage canal from the north to the south side of the area for which some work has already reportedly began. I really wished there was a way we can help and protect this land. You would have thought that this would be an important area that needed protected. I mean there are what about any where from 750 to 1750 orangutan..They're classified as endangered now.,1
"I feel like the Syrian war situation is just completely out of control at this point, but what often bothers me more is that people who supported Obama for both terms had a sort of blind spot on this issue. When the Arab Spring happened and then the Libyan war and now the Syrian war (et cetera) there was very little meaningful opposition to it from the Democrat-voting side of the aisle. Republican lawmakers just pretended to be opposed to thwart Obama, if they even did that. In reality, the whole government supported ""removing Assad"" and because that objective was considered SO important, now we have the current situation of extreme tragedy. I feel like it is hard to convey how important this is.",1
"I can not believe that their is still such hate in the world. When I read stories like this I think about how we really need to come together and rid the world of such hate. All those times we talked about things like this happening all over the world really make you think about your own life and what we are doing to make a change/positive impact on the world. I think it is very sad to see lives wasted in this manner such as careless deaths that will get no one anywhere. I know that you have told me a lot of the same things, so I wanted to see how you felt about this too.",1

Nothing gets to me more than hearing about hungry children. Nobody should go hungry. There's so much food in this world. It breaks my heart to hear about kids fainting in school because they've only had one meal for the day. I wish there was a way to help these kids more directly. I'm not one to give to large non-profit organizations but I feel so bad for these kids.,1
"I just read an article Regarding a severe problem in the Chicago area with the fact that their public water supply has high amounts of lead traces. Just what I need, another worldly problem to stress about?!  Article shook me, as the health of not only myself but my children is of the upmost importance to me. I know, I don’t live in the Chicago area, but the article certainly made me think about the water that I drink every day, and my children drink and then just threw foods that I have cooked and prepared. Even my local town has just posted something on the fact that they need $3.2 million to repair the water mains in the one square-mile town as the water pipes are corroded and near health hazard. I Will be researching this locally. I will also be researching for more info on the subject",1
"My heart hurts for those affected. I will be praying for the soldiers attacked and their families. As we approach memorial day, we need to reflect on what we have learned in past wars and one thing is clear, mustard gas is not a weapon that should be used, I understand that many of the attacks going on right now include Guerrilla warfare but we cannot fight back in the same ways.",1
"I feel sad when reading this story, as she lost her companion and that's just what some animals are to people their companion, not just a dog or a pet, it's a part of them. This man was wrong for what he did although he was justified because it was seen as self defense he definitely could have done something else before fatally shooting the dog and killing it. Unless the dog was charging at him and starting to bite him or bark at him he should have seen no threat at that time and I feel like this was a careless mistake and he didn't need to do so.",1
"I bring you sad news today, my friend. A male wolf member of the Huckleberry pack has been slaughtered. How can they do this without consequences? This event happened in Montana. I have heard similar stories in that region of wolves being gunned down, especially from helicopters. It makes my heart feel heavy. I know you will feel the same way. I am strongly considering giving a donation to the Center for Biological Diversity because they are fighting on behalf of wolves to stop this murder. It was so cruel because the male was simply wandering for a mate. He didn't deserve what happened.",1
I just dont have many feeling about this article. I guess i feel bad for the teachers but it doesnt exactly bother me. I am not too concerned with affairs in other countries unless it is about war or peace and political things. Packing up and having to move your live away in just a few days is very hard and i guess i feel some sympathy about that.,1
The article i read about the Venezuela zoo where the animals starving due to food shortage. the country economical condition go down and rise the prices of food. The country can't manage to import food due to bad economical siyuation. Animals on the Caricuao Zoo staffers have been feeding carnivorous lions and tigers diets of mango and pumpkin.

Anyway so I read this story about Myanmarl; they are having a huge investigation about child slavery, its very sad we live in a world that is filled with monsters like this.

It's a little bit troubling that these teachers would be forced to leave because of political tension. It's not right that they would lose their jobs and their homes. There should be another way to resolve this issue. It's good that people are protesting this and they should be. Teachers play such a huge role and it will not be good for the students to be in the middle of this.,1
We are living in a world that ha problems left and right and sometimes I can't help but to be sad because so many people and animals are suffering.Rivers are drying in some places and ll the fishes are dying while some areas have flash floods that destroy things and kill people.This are end times and am saddened all the time by such issues.,1
"Ha.  Get him, snake! I'm so proud of that snake. If you don't want to be crushed by an angry python, maybe don't use the poor thing to do tricks for people. I mean, crushing the warm thing until it stops moving is kind of what giant snakes do. I hope they didn't kill the snake, poor baby. She was just defending herself, basically.",1
"This is disgusting. As many of you know, I am an animal lover. There is not much that makes me sad, upset and angry like any instance of an animal suffering. What this man did is unforgivable. I hope he has a mental illness. I cannot think of any other reason why someone would do something so cruel.",1
"How sad, if you get a chance read this and maybe share, it could be the difference for this person to find her family! Sometimes I see these announcements and I usually read and share them, I hope they find who she is and most importanly I hope they find her family and get her some help. I think the more people see, read and share this info, the bigger the chance to find her identity and family, imagine if it was someone you knew.",1
"I think it is important to ensure safe drivers on our roads, for our family’s sake. I believe that the rate of accidents on American roads is far higher than acceptable. I believe there should be more restrictive driving requirements and testing, as well as harsher punishments for drivers who do not respect the riles of the road.",1
"See? This is why sometimes I rather ignore the news. Shootings over there, people dead over here, drugs, etc. It makes me sick the kind of world we live in. Hundreds of deaths just because they thought these people were related to drug dealing? I mean, did they even had some kind of proof? Why shoot to kill? Why not stick to the laws and put them in jail if they were found guilty?",1
"This is so sad guys. :( I can't believe this, I never knew how far reaching climate change actually was. These poor turtles are dying because of the temperature changes. Please do something, write your local senator so we can start to reverse this. We need to get back into the climate accords and become a leader in environmental sustainability, instead of what we have been doing.",1
"A lot of us not just veterans are losing sleep. I believe its because of deppression. We aren't happy and its because of money. Humans are always working they have no life. Work is not life. Some people don't get to spend time with there kids or family. They cant even have time for themselves. There worried about work, what time they have to get up, or what they will eat because they don't have time to cook. So we eat unhealthy thing that can lead to depression. Not getting enough sleep or the right nutrients lead to sicknesses. Theres people who don't have enough time to see a doctor. Our lifestyle is the reason we're not getting enough sleep. People put way to much on there plate just so they can have money. Everything is about money.",1

"Hey, did you read this article? South Korea always seems to have something going on. 26 were hospitalized and 29 were treated at the scene.

Dude I seriously cannot believe what happened at the zoo not too long ago. A kid fell into a moat in May when he fell through the barrier. Wow it must have been so terrifying for the family. Then the gorilla picked up the boy and carried him a little bit. They actually ended up shooting the gorilla which is so sad.,1
"The reason why they're killing people over there is because the Allied Forces are occupying their country.  If only we would keep our nose out of others' business, then maybe, just maybe the world would become a better place.  But as with all empires (and America is no different ), they eventually fall because of internal forces.",1
"Did you hear about what had happened to the kid in china. They found his body dead in a desserted well in China after he was helping his father pick some vegetables or something like that. I just feel like if he was helping his father, then it is hard to believe that his dad did not know he had fallen into the well. Either way, sad story.",1
"Did you hear about the airstrikes in Yementi? I can't believe it. i would have been petrified!   Forty three people were killed, but could be up to sixty.. The bodies were just laying everywhere.and they were covering them with blankets.    This is just one count of those that died. Since the battle has been going on they say over 10,000 people have died from this conflict, many just innocent civilians.  I can't imagine being in that situation.",1
Hearing about the violence going on over politics in the country is really sad and upsetting. It's easy to take for granted how we live and how lucky we are that we don't have to worry about people killing us on a daily basis. Our government is also democratic which means people have a voice. This isn't the case in some areas/,1
"I have come across an article about the civilian casualties in Afghanistan. The war is such a terrible thing. Small children are dying just because of some military operations, i.e. some grown-ups cannot negotiate and agree on resolution of the disagreements. My heart aches as I read that burnt children corpses are tended by mourning relatives. It must be unbearably painful to exist in such pitiful condition in such a poor country and on top of that to lose your children. Life is so unfair and cruel sometimes.",1
Hey have you heard about the polar bears? This global warming thing is going to take over there home land so fast. They will not be able to out swim the things that will b more of a chance at getting them because of whats happening right now. We have to help save the polar bears. Its been pretty terrible how the goverment and companoes just dont care to help save these animals.,1
"These pellet guns almost seem like they were meant to maim individuals, under the guise of a less-lethal round. The fact that the ammunition seems to have been modified to cause more damage, more permanent damage, seems to back that up. It's a travesty that such violence is being committed, such life changing violence. These people are not dying, they're being irreparibly harmed, altered, changed for the rest of their lives. More people should be talking about the use of such ""non-lethal"" weapons. Can't the local force exercise some restraint, some humanity? It's confusing, because I can't think of any reason other than harm someone would introduce maiming pellets as such as the case here.",1
"India Kashmir: The teenager blinded by pellets — Photographer Abid Bhat here describes the life of 14-year-old Insha Mushtaq, who lost vision in both her eyes after being hit by pellets in Indian-administered Kashmir. ""I just want to ask the security personnel who fired pellets at me what my fault was,"" Miss Mushtaq says, as she stands by the same window she was sitting at when pellets blinded her. She has been in and out of hospitals for the past three months in an attempt to regain her vision. Nothing has worked so far, but she remains hopeful. Ms Mushtaq says she wanted to become a doctor before losing her vision. She brings out her text books to show me, and flips the pages though she cannot read them anymore. ""I can only feel them now,"" she says tearfully",1
"I just read about some girls losing their parents. It was very bad. They went to a theme park to enjoy themselves and their parents were killed in front of them. It was a water ride, the kind that seats six at a time. Something mechanical happened on the ride. The maintenance check a few days prior was good, but something screwed up. There were four adults and two girls. The ride flipped over and trapped the adults. The little girls somehow escaped, but their parents were among the four dead. Apparently, the park workers didn't even notice it right away. One of the girls was by the ride exit by herself. The girls may need a lot of counseling for the rest of the lives. It was pretty bad. I would hate to see my family members die in front of me in a tragic accident like that.",1
"How can they do this to these people?  Did you see this?  How can you move people who were fleeing war and violence to another place after they had already settled there?  It's unbelievable, I feel so sorry for these people, and someone needs to step in and help them stay where they are currently comfortable.",1
"I read an article about the gender gap in the world today. Sadly the US has moved down in the list behind all of the major European countries. I guess the number of women working in senior positions is shrinking. There is also a decline of women in the labor force. But there is evidence that the education gender gap is shrinking, so there are more women educated. It just seems that more women are choosing not to work.",1
"Maybe they should evaluate him and figure out why he did what he did so that when he gets released, he's not tempted to do it again.  The story really didn't tell why he did it or if he was mentally challenged or anything, it just says that he injured the bird.  The bird is a sad case of what a zoo is.  Those animals should be in the wild, and not cooped up for people to ooh and aah at them in a park",1
I thank God because my sisters were born in USA instead of those countries in the middle east who still believe in male guardianship.Can you imagine a woman seeking permission fro a male figure who is a relative and sometimes a son to acquire a passport?that is so bad.I hope the activists will succeed in helping this women because this is so outrageous.,1
"Trump refuses to take a salary from the government for being president. Well he is rich so $400,000 is probably nothing to him.

Im not a Trump supporter but I like the idea that he chose to save the government money.",1
"What a terrible tragedy!  Accidents like this hit families so hard... and losing both a father and son this way!  The poor family must be just beside themselves.  It seems too, if one looks at the circumstances, that they were close and enjoyed doing things together.  How very sad.  The rest of the family must be just shaken to the core.  Hopefully they are a tight knit group with support systems.  I hate to hear about anyone in accidents, but this sort of thing is just too sad.",1

A two year old in Willoughby Hills East of the Cleveland area fell from his eleven story apartment building. His parents were in the living room and had no idea that this had taken place.

"Oh my goodness, did you read this article? It was heart-wrenching... I felt so sad while reading it and my heart breaks for the mother of these babies.  There is no way that a parent should ever, ever have to lose a child,muchless two children at the same time. So horrifying and sad!  Something has to be done about all of this. They deserve justice!!",1
"I'm always upset to hear about violence erupting as a result of lives lost due to police action. I believe most police officers are good people, but there is a pervasive issue of racism ingrained in many police departments. The protests were certainly justified. Police should be subjected to psychological testing to determine whether they have an inclination toward racism. Those that do need to be removed from active duty immediately.",1
I feel bad for the teachers but there are so many teachers in this country that I would like to see expelled. It is amazing how much power Turkey has. I do not really understand this power but it must be difficult to pack up your life so quickly. I can't imagine having to do that. How does anyone start fresh when they were expelled. You would always feel like it is going to happen again.,1
"There is a bacteria outbreak in Wisconsin.  Fever, chills, shortness of breath and has killed a few people.  The problem is they do not understand or can't identify where the bug is coming from.  Tap water or ground water is unlikely but they can't rule it out.  Pretty scary.  Its not a superbug in a sense that it does respond to some medicines.",1
"The situation in Yemen with the Saudi-led coalition against the Houthi rebels is one with a lot of controversy, and for good reason. This conflict is rife with airstrikes and drone strikes that drop on civilians and militants alike. Qatar is culpable in the slaughter of citizens, which puts them firmly against the Geneva Conventions. Of course, I do not celebrate the loss of their soldiers' lives, as their families back home are just regular citizens as well in all likelihood.",1
There are immigrants in this country that are having a hard time assimilation in to the American Culture. The article blames Trump I believe there are most things at work here than just him. It seems the system is working as intended and it was in place before Trump. People need to be able to assimilate as it keeps our country at peace. What do you think we should do about it?,1
"It kind of worries me a little bit because sometimes I go through phases where I have a really hard time falling asleep or staying asleep. It's so weird. It happens or no reason and it last's for like 2 weeks and then all of a sudden stops and doesn't happen again for awhile. Sometimes I'm so tired and I really want to fall asleep but I just can't. I try everything, melatonin, warm milk, an eye mask and a fan or white noise but nothing works and then all of a sudden I'm fine again and no problems.",1
"If it's not bad enough that the father is a child molester who molested his own child, the mother had the nerve to join in on the abuse. I doubt very serious if she was forced to do it as she could have divorced him or left him rather commit such a heinous crime and money is no excuse. I wouldn't molest my child for all the money in the world. These people were just sicking perverse sorry excuses for human beings.",1
It's about time! I really support them doing this petition. I hope that they take it seriously and are able to liberate the Saudi women who have been oppressed for so long. You would never see that kind of ownership/guardianship system in places like the United States. Maybe feminism really is sparking change around the world.,1
"I would feel absolutely horrible to be in any of these parents shoes, I feel like they probably think they are completely lost, anxious, deserted. I would be a complete mess. I dont know exactly what i would do in that situation. I feel like the chaces are good neough for them to try for that second baby but i do inderstand them not wanting to rry because of the small chances of the other one having the zika virus anyways.",1
"An article talking about increasing the deportations of Haitians is one that I feel for those involved. Haiti has been brutalized by mother nature, and the Clintons, and people are trying to get somehwere to survive while the country recovers. The U.S. let's them in to ship them back out and that is a bit ridiculous. It's not a situation where those from Mexico just sneak over and hide from society. These people need help but it doesn't shock me that the U.S. wiould do this in a time of need. Sympathy felt but helpless to do anything about it.",1
isis is now one of the major terrorists group operating in iraq . the Iraqi security forces are in constant war with it . isis have killed around 800 ppl in Iraqi city of Mosul and using 1000s of civilian as human shield to stop Iraqi forces advance and it make me worried that when it going to stop . we eliminate one group and another one pop up . this is a major concern for the world,1
I'm sorry to hear that about Dakota's parents. Even when you are adult it must be hard to see your parents splitting up. No one wants that to happen and it's unfortunate that her parents couldn't work it out. I hope they are able to still remain civil around the kids and family. Just because it didn't work romantically doesn't mean it won't work at all.,1
"I feel like there is so many people out there that are less fortunate then us, we need to take a second to see how people feel about themselves and the situations they are in and the people around them. I feel like the person writing this has gone through alot in his life and this all just adds into the fact of everything else",1
Its sad that now and moving forward in my lifetime we will see many older actors and actresses succumb to death in its many forms. It makes me feel for those people and gain a sense of time in a view that is not endless. I can put myself in the shoes of someone older and battling health problems and it saddens me to do so.,1
I always read about these house fires and never think about them again. That is something that I should do less of. Maybe I can find a way to donate time or money for families in tragedies so that they can get back on their feet as soon as possible. This recent reversal of my attitude was because a friend of mine recently had their apartment burn out due to a building fire.,1
"This is awful! I just read that a family lost two family pets and their home due to a horrible fire, still in investigation! This is one of those times when I let my mind wander and I think, what is going to happen to them? Where would they sleep at night? And the pain they must feel for not having the pets, and a place to call their own.",1
I read that apparently a man in Georgia was accused of deliberately leaving his son in the car to die from the heat. I really hope he gets the death penalty and they leave him in a hot car just like he did to his son. The world is filled with evil people and it was really disturbing to hear this story.,1
"I hate that tourism and economy end up hurting our animal's habitats! People are so selfish while traveling, and they do not think of how their actions will effect the wildlife in the area. Please remember to clean up your trash, do not litter, and do not leave items out that will potentially hurt animals when you are visiting an area. Countries need to spend more time and effort on saving natural areas for wildlife.",1
"I just can't imagine that this poor 4 year old was blinded the way she was. But then I wonder if it is truly an act of justice to carry out the same punishment on the perpetrator. It seems so human to want revenge, but it also feel so useless. In a way it seems to make ""us"" as ""bad"" as him. It just makes me sad.",1
"I just read this article about a haze that was responsible for killing 100,000 people. Can you believe that!? The haze was caused by fires used to clear rain forest, if I remember correctly. I mean could you imagine that happening here. It is unfathomable. I know we have our wildfires but very few people die to them. Imagine what people are going through.",1
"Hello, I have just read this article and have to say that it was a very good and interesting read. It is about the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and they discuss how smoking should be banned in all parks, zoos, and playgrounds to reduce the chances of children growing up thinking that using cigarettes is normal. I can see why some might say that this is the last step before criminalization of the product and consumer.",1
it is frightening to learn about all these shark attacks but these surfers should be aware of the risks associated with the sport.  relocating the sharks should be a priority and it would be in the best interest to establish a moratorium on water sports until the shark epidemic is dealt with.  closing beach in australia is a good precautionary method,1
I agree with this article completely. I used to take the pill for awhile and it did change my moods and make me feel weird and just off. So I switched to the depo shot and same thing. It made me feel super depressed and also made me gain a lot of weight. I have had some kind of bad side effect with every birth control I've ever tried. I refuse to take any form of birth control now except for condoms and I track my cycle so I know when I'm fertile.,1
I just read this article about the doom of bananas that made me feel like an idiot. I like to think i am smart enough to process this type of article but the words used just had me lost. I wouldn't bother reading it if you still planned on it. It was informative but i felt like i was reading a manual.,1
"So a man murdered someone over a card being declined. At a Starbucks of course, this is just getting to be ridiculous. Someone gets pissy because they have no money and decide to hurt someone else that has nothing to do with it. The more news articles I read like this, the less faith I have in humanity.",0
"Hey,  I think that you should check out this article. I feel bad for the citizens down in Mexico City and South America. They are going through some troubled times and America is barely doing anything to help out with their situation. Those children do not deserve the life they are going through at the moment and I believe that we should do something to make them feel like they are proud to be apart of their country.",0
Some scum bag is at it again stealing naked pictures of people simply because they are celebrities and he can make money from doing it.  It blows my mind the level of shit people will do in order to make a buck.   It seems like people treat celebrities as if they are not people at all.  People that leave negative comments on celebrity pages are taking it to a new level.  People say the shittiest things to each other when they're hiding behind their computer screen.   This particular guy took it to the extreme by stealing their private photos.,0
"This is a sad story. There is a Rhino Orphanage, but a beloved rhino just passed about. They tried so hard to save this rhino, and unfortunately the baby rhino named Thula is the area that this happened in. It never gets easier. The other rhinos here are being taken care of, but it was a great loss, and we all feel so bad about it. The name of the baby rhino was Isibindi, and she will be missed.",0
"I cannot stand Donald Trump and his fear mongering. Most Muslim people I know are very, very kind people. It is so unfortunate there are so many hate crimes because of the ignorance our President continues to blast on twitter. It's not just Muslims. It's everyone that is not part of the Alt-White movement. Jewish people, LBGTQ people. Black people. It is fueled by hate and ignorance. Trumps Muslim ban did more harm than good! He just caused fear, creating a deeper divide in our country. It's sad.",0
"Trump continues to fuck up the nation. Did you read this story of how Trump wants to back out of the Paris Accord? As a nation we are finally trying to seriously address climate change and we are doing that with partners around the world. However, Trump the national embarrassment has seen to it that not only do we not continue trying to make the planet better, but we also betray our allies.",0
"I pretty much hate all wildlife including squirrels. They should  just go blast the little varmint. After all squirrels carry rabies and other diseases even if they say small animals seldom have rabies. Once you bite a human, it's over and you deserve to die. It is kind of funny though these elderly people not being able to get away. Why does everything wacky always happen in Florida. Like 30% of anything strange happens in Florida. Frankly I think some reporter made the whole thing up. Squirrels are not going to attack multiple people. Sure they might on a rare occasion bite someone but not three people. Then again it's Florida so common laws and logic go out the window. ANyhow thought you might enjoy some rambling on some things I read. Take care buddy. Later.",0
This will not end well. People have to improve their own country. Taking a shortcut by moving to a better country will just result in the host country suffering. The best citizens will work hard to improve their country. They will not give up and leave. Lots of blood was shed in many of the countries that migrants seek to live in.,0
Oh my god. Did you hear about this story of this family of two girls that got killed on Halloweed? Apparently they were hit in a trailer and that cause them to die. Could you imagine just wanting to go out and have fun while trick and treating but then you get the sad news that you daughters are dead? This is heartbreaking for that family.,0
"I don't really understand the uproar over some birds.  Maybe I am being just unsympathetic, or maybe I'm not as understanding as I thought I originally was.  To spend all this money, and all this time, to save these birds, seems kind of silly to me.  Why don't we focus the funds on something else that actually helps people?",0
This is sad that a company that is based here in the US and that actually manafucters its products in the US is in debt. More effort should have been placed to ensure company's success. More companies should be encouraged to manufacture their products in our country while also making them affordable and appealing.,0
"Wow.  Let me get this straight: The German Consulate are ""invaders"" but all of the Middle East and North Africa pouring into Europe like the Camp of the Saints is ""refugees"" and if we complain about it, we're racists.  Here's an idea:  All Muslims, Arabs, and whatever else we're not supposed to notice this week can go back to the Middle East, and then our ""invading"" consulates and embassies will be HAPPY to go back to where we came from.  Never speak to us again.  Ugh.  ""The Taliban.....""  Yeah, no, the word you're looking for here is MUSLIMS.  The MUSLIMS are the problem, not the Taliban.",0
"Was this really Neo-Nazi fucktards?  Or was this a left-wing attempt to incite minorities and drive them to the polls?  Why are we not past this crap?  Ridiculous.  I love a lot of things about being Southern, but this crap drives me nuts.  Who does this?  Can we bring back the stockade?  Tar and feather?",0
"I'm glad I don't wear contacts, because I'm so lazy with them that I would likely become infected and that would be horrible for my already terrible eyes. I read an article that said that people who leave their contacts in while they sleep are more likely to get an eye infection that can cause blindness. Makes me wish I could fix my vision to perfection again. I hate that I have terrible eyesight and have to rely on primitive glasses or risky contacts. It's not  fair and I am very upset about it. Does anyone want to donate their eyes to me? I promise I will take good care of them. If only I could grow new eyes or get badass bionic cyborg eyes that can shoot lasers, then i could defeat the bacteria and be a hero to the human race. Well that's all silly pipedreams. I just have to deal withit",0
"Hey, here's another article that I'm sending to you for no good reason, since neither of us are interested in this kind of thing. It looks like more people died for shitty reasons, but maybe some are still alive. And, if there's anything that people love, it's the idea that things can be ok and / or get better. People fucking love this stuff. But, I did think that the bit about a HEN being rescued was out of place. haha. So, what do you think?",0
"Male models are paid a lot less than female models, which is interesting considering all of the news lately about a ""wage gap"" that some people believe exists. Each industry has a different set of pay and things and that's fine, you have to look at the individual characteristics when judging whether something is wrong. It's very interesting that this is starting to change though, as male products become a bigger market for companies.",0
"This is what happens when you take in people from an archaic civilization.  All of these refugees need to be throw back into their mud pit. Their religion embraces hatred. Let them figure out how to live in peace in their own countries, then we can allow them into civilized world. Is it is now, I think all of Europe is doomed.",0
This article held some very valid views that I have been trying to explain for years. The hypocrisy that America generates is overwhelming and others can see this too. We are holding ourselves so high up as a free country meanwhile a black man can not even get pulled over without having a white man pulling a gun on him.,0
"It may make me sound horrible, but I'm torn on this. No one should have to suffer like that for the crime of theft, it's barbaric, but if it really was a twenty-something that was part of an armed gang, I'm slightly less sympathetic about their victims retaliating. If it was a child, however, this is insanity and just horrifying.",0
If you are wearing contacts for your vision to improve then you should be sure to take them out when sleeping.  You can get some bacteria in your eye that will accumulate and might cause problems if you do not do this.  I forgot what the thing was called but it might even cause the contact user to become blinded.,0
"I think China has a real problem with safety standards and that's why they have so many accidents in their various industries. It's really sad that they place economic growth over human lives. If they did implement safety standards, they wouldn't lose so many lives or potential workers and people that care for children.",0
This really saddens me that people are so lost now a days. It never solves anything to hurt other people and this just shows a lack of judgement and remorse. It feels as though there had been a disconnect with humanity and we do not have the respect for each other that e once had. I hope that this person can find their way to a better path.,0
"I can't say that I specifically care about the election, and would rather have someone besides the two main parties win for once. I also personally dont like Trump, as I find him to be a rather bombastic idiot, and wish Hillary wuold have won, though I didn't particularly want either of them. I hope he takes the stress of the election into becoming a better leader.",0
"I think it is crazy that these employees were put through this at Well's Fargo. I have never worked at a bank before, but being told to reach a quota, even by the means of doing illegal tasks to accomplish what they needed to do. I can't imagine coming into working everyday and wondering if I was going to be considered a good or a bad employee. It would infuriate me to have earned a bonus and then be told I cannot have it because I am being developed as an employee. I am glad they decided to make the change. It sounds better for their employees.",0
"Did you hear about the 3 year old that climbed into the gorilla enclosure and was dragged around by the gorilla. The zookeepers had to shoot the gorilla. Apparently, there were no problems with the barrier. I'd like to know how the little boy got in there. Based on what I read, I don't really take issue with the zoo or the gorilla. The barrier was at the right standard, and the gorilla did what a gorilla is going to do if something like that happens. I place the blame on the parents who somehow let their 3 year old child climb into a gorilla enclosure. Were they not paying attention?",0
"If you hear a ringing in your occasionally, don't be too alarmed. If you hear it persistently for quite some time, I would be slightly worried and definitely more alarmed. This could mean that you eventually lose your hearing. Tinnitus is a common thing to experience and usually is nothing. But sometimes this can be an early sign that you could lose your hearing. I strongly encourage people to go and get this checked if they experience frequently and definitely educate yourself on it.",0
"Poor orangutan. I hope her treatment is successful and she is able to return to living in the wild, or at least in a zoo. You hear a lot of stories these days about illegal animal trading. Humans need to learn that wild animals are not there for our entertainment and should be kept in their habitats.",0
"I just read that Kevin Meaney, a standup comedian and actor has died. Although I don’t remember him very well, according to the article I read he was a celebrity of some notoriety in the 1980’s and 1990’s. Mr. Meaney was in the CBS sitcom ""Uncle Buck,"" it was only on for one season in 1990, and he made an appearance on an episode of ""Saturday Night Live. He was on the Johnny Carson show, too, which was the top-rated late night talk show for decades. I really miss all the bright comedic talents that launched their careers on the Carson show. So many of these great comedians of the past have inspired budding comic talents of today. They will be missed!",0
"Floyd Mayweather owes a jewelry store some money. It seems like it's the richest people in the world that always find some excuse either not to pay taxes or not to pay someone money that is owed. He has all that money, and he has to be sued to pay for something that he could have easily paid for in full upfront. People like him are ridiculous. There are so many people out here starving, and here he is sitting in his mansion not paying for something he bought.",0
"Gosh, the emotions I felt while reading that. Being a nurse, I would be so scared of such a mass emergency and worrying about it people would make it or not. It disgusts me that innocent people would be used as human shields. How could someone do that to someone else? And they purposely brought them into the center of the city with the intention of using them as human shields.",0
"It is unfortunate that Venezuela seems to go through so much as a country due to politics. I do not know why the United States of America will not be more proactive in helping this less fortunate country. A lot of people complain about Chavez, but that seems to be when the country was the most stable.",0
I am not sure what I just read. It seems to be about some sports event which I care little about. Sports are not my favorite thing and I don't know how anyone could lose sleep over a sports event. Much more important things in life. I also am not sure how to write such a long talk based on a very short paragraph about sports.,0
"Yo. I hope that you are ready to read a long ass article about things that both did not make a difference in the election and things that enough people decided did not fucking matter. It's another take on ""look at what an asshole trump is"" It's totally true, but nothing changed because of things like this so I don't see the reason of rehashing it. Trump's a real mother fucker, but he was a white man, so enough assholes voted for him. Anyway, please enjoy yet another garbage article.",0
"I don't believe this at all.  I think people are overreacting to the news that Trump was elected president.  There are always bad apples out there, no matter who the president is.  To blame this on the president, right after he was even elected, is wrong.  Give the guy a chance and get over it and try to make something positive of this.",0
"What a terrifying ordeal that these plaintiffs went through. If I was them, I would be suing whoever was responsible, too. I try to avoid putting myself into situations like these, but life often does not care what you want. I hope that these people get the closure that they are seeking. I know I would want closure.",0
"Reading an article that is basically on the fear and risk of the Zika Virus and how it is currently an issue. It doesn't affect my fellings at all. It is clearly and issue but they'll make a vaccine for those who don't become immune by way of their own system, then the virus will become resistant to the vaccinations and it will be a never ending up and down cycle that we see all the time. I simply just can't let something like this, despite the risk, affect my feelings and emotions.",0
"Reading the article, I was disgusted knowing that a father had not only killed himself but took away the lives of his two sons as well. The only reason why that man even killed himself was that the police saw him killing his two children. People in this world today shouldn't lose their lives due to a crazy/selfish elder.",0
"This is totally unsurpising for the UAE. The laws are usually lenient in these extreme cases though, which makes this occurence a strange one. There is some ulterior political motive at work here. This woman's misfortune is being used to advance some goal most likely. I wonder what they're up to. What do you think?",0
I just read an article about the awful treatment of animals of zoos in foreign countries from us. Feeling a little down thinking of how these people could treat the animals how they could continue to raise animals in zoos where people will come and view them while they're ill hurt and some even dying. Even after receiving help to get these animals to a better location where they can be cared for properly other zoos are still continuing with bad treatment and allowing visitors to come witness it. Just like a child animals depend on us if we have them caged either let them out of the cage or take care of them why is that so hard for people to understand or do?,0
"Not that we need to necessarily get ourselves overly involved in the affairs and well-being of other countries, but we should definitely be paying attention to what is going on in the world around us. There is human suffering everywhere and I think that most of the time we are completely oblivious to it, or we don't want to face it. I believe that it is a good thing to be able to realize how cruel human beings can be to one another and to appreciate what we have when we have it and not take things for granted. Considering we could always have it much worse.",0
"While reading this article all I could think of is how much of a shame and alarming it is of the recent shootings that have been taking place all over the USA. I know we have talked about guns and ownership in the past, but I'm starting to think it is important to look at what we can do to stop these acts and how we can make a change ourselves. I also was surprised that they did not try to take the story and flip it into being some type of political debate about how the shooter was made about politics or a race war.",0
"I have never heard of any of the people mentioned in this article.  I did not even know that there is a monarchy in Thailand.  It sounds like the king that died recently was very well liked by the Thai people.  Anyway, I hope that this lady heals quickly from her illness and that she has a prompt recovery.",0
"It is sad that this is what is needed to get some people to pay attention to the immense damage that has been and is continuing to be done by global warming. Something should not have to affect you in order for it to matter. There are things that are a lot more important than your coffee fix. For instance, the people-like the people in the story-whose livelihoods are being put in danger because of global warming.",0
Reading about atrticles like this in a country i dont care about has no meaning to me. Im lower class worker in the USA. This kind of stuff makes no difference in my life because i struggle to even feed my kids. People facing hardship in other coutries is there problem not mine and i have no real feeling towrds those people,0
"This article is very, very, eye-opening and interesting to read about the the seven biggest threats that President Trump poses to the environment. I think with President Trump backing out of the Paris Agreement and not really focusing a little bit of more efforts on global warming, there can be a big problem in the future.",0
"So sad! The middle east just keeps getting worse.  I hate what’s happening to these people, but I’m not sure how to solve it.  I wish there was a simple, easy fix.  However, it seems like every time we try to fix something it just gets worse.  It’s such a complex situation with no easy answer.  Unfortunately, I don’t see it being solved any time soon.",0
"Just read that due to climate change, hotter than normal temps may be the new normal. In 2013, temps screamed up to 122 F. in Australia, which is frightening. But when you think about who really has the capacity to change this -- which is each individual -- it gets even more frightening. The primary cause of climate change is just too many people, full stop. I do not have much hope that people will stop procreating to save themselves, and this is the biggest tragedy of all.",0
"I didn’t know that cocunuts are becoming in short supply.  It was a very interesting article.  I didn’t realize how many things are made with cocunut or that they have some kind of bank type of thing to keep the seeds.  I find it so amazing to learn about things I knew nothing about.  I love cocunuts and did buy some cocunut oil but haven’t used it yet.  I heard that the oil was good for your skin and hair, although I haven’t tried it yet.  Reading the article made me think about the show “Naked and Afraid” since the players are often in the jungle, trying to survivor and finding cocunuts on the trees.  Or on the TV show Survivor, where they often eat and drink coconut juice.  In honesty, I don’t know if I have ever eaten a cocunut even though I thought I did.  I eat mangos, kiwi’s and oth",0
There was this crazy story in the news the other day. Two guys were shot in Pennsylvania. One was shot twice in the stomach and the other was shot in the back. There were no arrests or anything and there was not stated motive. I wonder if it was a random thing or if they were involved with drugs or something? I guess we'll never know...,0
"Jeez, who would have thought that those little guys could wreak such environmental disaster.  But this is a classic example of people who think their one indiscretion (dumping the fish in the river) is harmless.  Much like someone who starts a forest fire, we should have laws making the person responsible liable for the cost of cleaning up the mess.  Not that we'd ever catch them.",0
"Wow, can you believe he survived in the jungle that long on his own?  It is amazing what the human body is capable of hey?  I remember the last time I went a couple days without food and it was so intense.  People think they are ready to survive in the wild but we really have so few skills to get food for ourselves without the right tools.  It's amazing that he was found after all that time.  I wonder how long it will take for him to recover?",0
I can't believe that there has to be so much violence and bad in the world.  The part of this article that really got to me was that the Muslim women were being raped and that doctors and nurses who wanted to help the people there were being treated rudely.  It would be awful to have to live under these kinds of conditions.  It would be awful to have the prices of food go up because of blockades and other reasons.  It would be stressful and scary.,0
"There is some killing in Indonesia most likely related to Muslims. Overall I'm not surprised by this news, the Islam religion holds many radicals and there are enough proof that the top leaders of these Islam groups support oppression. Just look at at all the hajibs in these muslim countries these are sad pathetic men that are afraid of women.",0
"So, I just read this article about a series of bombing in New York and New Jersey and how these acts are being viewed as an act of terrorism. Sometimes I still cannot believe that we lived through 9/11, especially because before that I had never even heard the word terrorism or knew what a terrorist attack was. And now, we live in a world where we are constantly hearing about possible terror attacks or terrorists regularly on the news. It just makes me absolutely sick that this is the world I am raising my kids in and that we have to live in fear of someone trying to kill us or setting up bombs to surprise attack people. The fact that we cannot live a carefree life anymore because of the sick minds of individuals scares me daily and makes me wish I could keep my kids in a bubble!!!",0
This story is just sad and I just feel like there should be something that we can do to prevent killings of wild animals just because they own the earth as well as we do. Just because humans are expanding and advancing in technology it does not mean that we kill and we hunt everything that we see. It is heartbreaking.,0
"It aggravates me that in our modern society leaders are condemned before they even have an opportunity to lead. It will happen forevermore into the future no matter who wins elections from here on out. The issue is not opposition so much as it is the ability to organize against someone anymore. Using the internet, it is quite easy to gather a group of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands to combat against something vile or unwarranted. The problem is Trump wasn't even given a chance. Now that things have played out, perhaps some of those people were right about their hatred or grievances but its entirely unfair to subject any president of our country to this before they have even been given the chance to lead.",0
"Hey I was just reading an article about a teacher bashing president Trump. You know my position when it comes to Trump, you know I dislike the man and all; however, I do not believe a teacher can use his position to bash someone especially on school grounds. I believe he can state his opinion, but not disguise it as the truth. That could be very dangerous.",0
I think it is crazy to think that the Zika virus is just going to disappear. I'm really worried about getting bit by an infected mosquito and then getting pregnant. I wouldn't want anything to happen to my baby. This person thinks that we should just put girls in a room with infected mosquito's and let them get bit. I don't think you can prevent immunity that way. I don't think this virus is just going to disappear. I think something has to be done to prevent it from infecting more people. It needs to be controlled. I think it is sad for those that have already gotten the virus. Something has to be done to help these poor people.,0
"Oh, but global warming isn't real, right? We have all kinds of time to fix the problem, right? It's not humans, it's natural variation, right? Holy crap are we ever ostriches as a species - are we going to dig our heads out of the sand in time? Change has to happen, and it has to happen now, we can't wait for all the old white men who run things to die",0
"Do you know about Zika virus news ? That like dengue and West Nile virus, this mosquito-spread disease is now going to be a regular fixture — and a perennial risk for pregnant women. The huge bloom of Zika activity in the Americas right now is unprecedented. A longtime US Army scientist who is now semiretired, Halstead believes Zika will vanish in a few years, likely for decades. That’s the way another arbovirus, chikungunya works, he wrote in an article in Emerging Infectious Diseases last year. “The rate at which people are getting infected right now certainly suggests that we’re heading, within a year or two, to achieve sufficient herd immunity for this virus to die out,",0
"How awful. I have the feeling things like this are going to get more and more common - racists are going to feel more comfortable and much bolder if there's someone in office that seems to approve of actions like these. We need a leader who takes a strong stance against racism and hate crimes like this, or our country will continue to fracture.",0
It saddens and scares me that people don't see terrorists for what they are: radicalized individuals who have gone rogue. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people who just want to live their lives and practice their faith. This country needs to be educated on other cultures so we stop fearing the unknown. Building more walls and dividers between different groups of people won't help anything.,0
"It's so insane that people today, specifically white people, find the need to continue to discriminate against a group of people that they have already tormented for hundreds of years. There is something I call ""little man syndrome"" mostly referring to when short men feel the need to overcompensate for their height by being very aggressive and loud. The white people that commit these kinds of crimes suffer from a severe case of little man syndrome.",0
"I'm no parent and I completely believe Donald Trump is a horrible man. With that being said, I don't think it is correct to shun your child from having a different belief as you. Children should be able to freely be able to open up a discussion with their parents and analyze their opposing views without worrying if they will receive any type of punishment. I love jokes and pulling pranks, but to do that to your own child and then to publicly embarrass them...well that doesn't seem funny at all to me. It worries me that the child will from now on tiptoe around certain topics for fear of upsetting their parent.",0
It's weird how I don't really feel sorry for these people. Timeshares just seem like a terrible idea and I've always associated it with conspicuous consumption. Really...just rent a hotel room when you can go. Buying into a house with other people sounds like a total hassle and a problem waiting to happen. But I can't stand how grimy the companies are and how they jerk people around. It just shows that the whole timeshare concept is about digging into people's pockets. And the only way to get them to stop doing that is to put them out of business if they don't want to play fair.,0
Death to all cops! We cannot allow the police force to continue existing. They are nothing more than government sanctioned mass murderers that exist to protect White capitalist interests by slaughtering hundreds. We must deceively destroy the police as a concept without any hesitation or remorse. All police are our enemies! There are no good cops!,0
"Three quarters of a year after the Zika outbreak was declared a global health emergency, the virus has infected almost seven hundred thousand men and women across Latin America. One estimate in the tens of thousands represents the number of infected expecting mothers. This is feared to result in fetal deformities.",0
"That is just crazy that a person waiting on his surfboard was attacked by a shark.  That must have been pretty scary.  I am glad that he didn't lose a leg or anything, but still, that would have been very scary.  All of the sudden, boom, you are hit by a shark.  I don't think I would want to go to that place again to surf if I was a surfer.  I think people need to be cautious when surfing.  I don't think it is really our place to force sharks away, as they live in the water.  I think people just need to be smart and surf where there is a very low chance of being attacked by a shark.",0
A mayor and his bodyguards in the Philippines was shot and killed by local law enforcement. He was in to the illegal drug business. He was elected to take a stance against drugs. It's really weird to think that a mayor was the one taking part in the illegal drug trade. It makes me wonder who can you really trust. He was said to be a narco-politician. Sad to think the people can't even trust his own mayor.,0
"I don't understand what I read here.  The students were hijacking buses?  What the hell?  Regardless, the local police should not have turned them over to a drug cartel.  I'm sure they are probably dead by now, but I support the family finding out what happened and get justice.  They were kids, they didn't deserve to be killed for this.",0
"Man is there some issue with the quality of air in India.  I'm not sure if I would be willing to take a trip there.  There seems to be a heavy smog lingering over the town that has caused a number of respiratory illnesses as well as shut down some schools.  I have just read that air quality readings have been taken from some scientists.  They found the quality of the air to be like smoking 40 packs of cigarettes a day.  Yet, the local media is reporting something more like two dozen.  I'm not sure who to believe but either way it seems like quite a dangerous situation to me.",0
"That's incredibly disgusting. I feel like it should count as a hate crime, and everyone on that boat who had anything to do with that incident should be brought before a judge and made to answer for their involvement. I really hope the LGBT community organizes some kind of boycott; Royal Caribbean should be made to feel financial pain for their negligence",0
"Things seem to be quite bad in Yemen. I can't believe is not only the United States conducting drone operations or military operations for that matter in Yemen. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are also in it. Things must be very bad overthere. I have little background about the issue in Yemen, I wonder what it is that Saudi Arabia and Qatar have to gain hehre?",0
So there were the guys who were basically mad the government made local land into a wildlife refuge. They went as far as getting a militia together. They had guns and were watching. They had a whole group of them involved. The problem is they shot and killed someone. Can you say it went to far? I do. I think the whole thing was a bit much. I mean they just took over the federal land. You can't just do that no matter what you stand for.,0
"Hello Friend. How are you? How is your family? We had some time without contact, we should avoid that and always communicate. Of sure where you live this that I am going to say to you is already news but, friend, you must take care of you and your family please. I do not know if you found out but I read in a digital online newspaper samples of violence in Philadelphia, I could not get out of my head that you live in that place. Apparently a person who was armed shot in the stomach to an elderly man and another person who was accompanying him. One of the reports I've heard from the police is that the crime weapon has not been found, which makes me suppose that until now the police have no idea who was, and neither the clues to catch the bad guy. The police do not know anything so it means t",0
While this seems like good news that there are fewer and fewer cases of Zika I would be lying if I said it wasn't still alarming.  It seems very strange that such a huge virus with a widespread development and all of the media attention is now just a minor issue.  It's either hiding somewhere are there's worse on the way.  Or it could have all just been media hype to sell TV.  Hard to say but suspicious all the same.,0
"I don't really feel much of anything at all reading this, I think celebrity deaths are so common in the news that it is really difficult to conjure up any emotion about them. I guess I feel mild interest? I learned a few facts about the singer of a song I have heard fairly often over the years, so it is interesting to have new information, which always feels rewarding in a way. I guess I should feel sad but I just don't think it's possible for me to feel sadness every time I read about someone being dead. It makes me feel a bit tired I suppose.",0
I feel so bad for that innocent customer. This is something that is unfortunate and a random freak incident. All over a declined card this man got so upset that he had to take it out on other people. It is shocking to me that some people can have so much anger in them to do something like that. That person that was shot was just going there on a normal day to get coffee and now his loved ones can't see him no more all because someone got worked up over a declined card. I guess we need to have security every where nowadays it seems. No place is safe to go. You can't even go to the coffee shop without worrying someone is going to pull out a gun at you.,0
Thinking about air conditions in other countries I wonder if other countries who have the capability can help out. The article I read was about air quality and I wondered if it's hard to teach Indian citizens the affects of what they are doing. Maybe teaching them in school would help. It seems many people are suffering and changing for the better would benefit a lot of people. I guess us caring about those would also be beneficial to us because we all share the same planet.,0
Kylie Jenner pretending like she cares about other people.  She makes a transparent marketing move to promote her own product by making up reasons other companies products are bad.  It's disingenuous faux concern and anyone who reads it should see through the crap.  It is disgusting and she should just advertise like a decent human being would.,0
"I had to read another article with zero formatting for a survey. This one was about war in the Middle East. It was pretty depressing to read. Religion makes people do such horrible, hateful, stupid things. Apparently kids just pick up explosives, people get their heads blown off, little girls die for no reason. For what? Because someone's imaginary friend in the sky is slightly different from their imaginary friend in the sky? Ridiculous, disgusting. Imagine what these people could have accomplished if they dedicated themselves to knowledge instead. We could be on other planets, we could live for thousands of years or more. But nope, we'd rather hate and murder each other of something as stupid as ""God"" or ""Allah.""",0
I heard almost 80 people died from an explosion.  It was caused by lightening or something.  Crazy huh?  I hope nothing like that every happens here during a fuel crisis. Over 100 were injured.  So sad.  I wonder what all those people who survived are going to do.  Maybe the red cross will set up something.  How can I find out?,0
"According to a new study, the polar regions are continuing to melt. In a decade, a lot of the ice melted. This situation is really affecting polar bears because they live in that environment. I found out that they ambush seals as they come up out of the water. Whether we can change this trend or not, I am not sure about but we should try.",0
"I hate the conflict that is happening here. I feel for the three soldiers that died and their families. I guess I'm too much of a pacifist but I really wish that people could realize that this level of conflict is a waste of resources and lives. However, I also know that this isn't how the world works.",0
I think this situation will more or less quickly be resolved. It is just a temporary issue and I really believe the gas prices will go back to normal. I don't think there should be too much to worry about. I remember this happened around the crisis here back in 2009 and everything was settled rather quickly.,0
"This article was just ridiculous to me, I see the need to be protesting and freedom of speech and rights but we as people need to do peaceful protest not using armed militias to stand off on a protest. That is going against the very fundamentals of what liberals stand for. I think the group should have had some repercussions to what they did.",0
"I never knew there was a link between depression and birth control pills. I thought it would do the opposite because it allows women to have a full sex like without worrying about pregnancy, so they and their partners can feel more relaxed and open to exploring their sexuality. But now that i read the article I can see the link between hormone fluctuations and mood disorders since the two effect each other.",0
"The human rights groups are right. It is brutal. I'm glad we don't punish people like that in our country, but I also feel like this guy in question deserves it. The problem is that punishments like that end up being applied to people who don't deserve it too. In this particular case, I don't feel bad for the guy at all. He's a monster.",0
"This article I just read talks about another mass shooter. Well, not so much mass shooter like some of the recent ones, but they did open fire in public and kill 5 people. I can't help but feel disgusted that these things still happen. I really hope that this guy gets what he deserves, because this has to stop.",0
People in America are going to have it worse despite all the federal “inequality spending” done during the Obama administration. The article says that Trump and the congress are going to undo what Obama started. The article says that they are also trying to undo Obama care and that’s part of it.  I know Obamacare made me poorer by about $600 a month and I’m not rich!  It goes on about SS and how evil tax cuts are.  I don’t know what to think about this since the news these days are often fiction.  It seems to contradict itself by saying unemployment rates have dropped.  With more people working isn’t there more tax revenue?  Confused but I feel for the poor...,0
"I am not sure what to think of this article as I have probably a different opinion than most would. First of all why wouldn't she report this at the time it happened, instead of waiting years and years later to come forward? I get the whole he's a powerful person and nobody would believe her part, but who's really going to believe her years later and why would she come out with it now and not before? What change? Why is she willing to exploit this man years later but wasn't able to do it years before?",0
Who knew that a typhoon hitting two countries would be less disturbing that articles about trees and dust.  Our compassion is ruled by numbers and when two people die a storm we yawn.  But show us dead trees for tell us we are breathing residue for a toilet cleaner and we freeze with panic.  Perspective is a hard thing to find sometimes.,0
"While I obviously think that it is sad that an animal is dead since I love animals, what I mostly feel reading this story is aggravation. It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists. It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.",0
"They should really figure out if these earthquakes are due to fracking wastewater, and if so stop the practice. Politicians aren’t concerned about the plight of the ordinary people though. Fracking companies have lobbyists and money, while the victims of the earthquakes have neither. Ultimately nothing will get addressed unless something catastrophic happens.",0
"Well, I dont really feel much about this either way. I feel badly for the family of the victim, I'm sure they are devastated, but it's not surprising something like this would happen, given the type of things he wrote, and the climate in the country in which they lived. My thoughts of out to the family.",0
"Hey, I just read an article written by a snowflake that is melting under manmade ""global warming"". One thing I have never understood is how the communist party took over the environmental movement without a shot. Remember when we found out the founder of 'GreenPeace' left after discovering the flood of communist and socialist coming into academia and the organization he started? I wish someone would actually do some research instead of repeating the same old stuff.",0
"And in other news ushering in the apocalypse, Paraguay just mismanaged their water resources so poorly that one of their rivers almost completely has dried up, in addition to a drought. I feel like these types of things are going to become extremely common in our near future thanks to our current President's very uninterested feelings about global warming. We will likely never recover since we have long since not done enough to combat it, and millions worldwide are going to suffer and die as stuff like this becomes a seasonal thing.",0
Ugh have you seen what's going on in New Delhi?  The air pollution over there is horrible and so many people are getting seriously sick!  They are calling the city a gas chamber because the air quality is so bad.  I'm so glad we don't have to deal with that around here but I really feel for all of the children who are being affected by all of this.  I can't imagine how helpless parents feel when there's nothing they can do to help their kids.,0
"Take a look at this story that I found online.  It's about forest fires being spread out over a couple of different states, pretty interesting.  I know that I sent you the pictures of what was happening around here, but you might be also interested in reading this story about how it is happening all over the place.",0
"Hello friend,  This article cracks me up. As someone who hates Trump, I think it's hilarious. Realistically, the mother should've just talked to her son about the reasons she dislikes Trump. Trying to convince him that Trump is a immoral person would've been a better use of her time. What makes me mad though, is that people called CPS on her. People always trying to get involved in everybody's business.",0
"I wonder who shot him and where. Did he get shot in the chest? The arm? The leg? The back? Where????? And also, where was he when he got shot? Was he inside or outside of the club? Did he drive himself? Was he alone? Did anyone else get shot?????? Sooooo many questions, so little answers. Has anyone been arrested yet? Are there any suspects?????",0
"Take a look at this. It's very dry, and I don't understand half the words, but while I was reading it, I was feeling sort of glad that apparently plant and animal species are adapting to the warming climate. It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down. It may be our best shot. We could only be so lucky.",0
"The earthquake was terrible. Thankfully, they didn't have injured people, just frightened ones. As bad as the situation is, it could have been worse. While people have no homes, they have their lives and the lives of their loved ones. It is terrible these people don't have a particularly safe place to stay right now, and the thought of losing everything you own is catastrophic. But, you can rebuild your life with your family.",0
"A reward of $25000 is being offered to catch somebody who is killing horses in the Salt River area. There are several murders of horses every year. Anyways, the group raising the money started a campaign on GoFundMe, and people have donated $25000. The group also is concerned with conservation-related issues.",0
"This is something that the Geneva Convention would ban from use in warfare, as it is inhumane and immoral as a tactic. I am very saddened by the turmoil in the middle east. Often I think about how we got here and why it got so bad and blame the powerful and privileged countries, including mine, have caused these conflicts. It feels like it will never end, a hopeless situation. I feel powerless to help anyone over there myself, I can only vote here and hope for the best in the end. Maybe someday the people over there will be much safer and happier.",0
"Michael Moore did it again! The man might not be much to look at, but he continually nails liberals social values with an iron fist. This time it was him predicting Trump's victory in a film, but what next? He is serving as a light post for liberals, trying to wake them up that aspects of the Democratic party are out of tune with the greater American people, but will they listen? Trump won for many reasons, and while he encourages liberals to tell their conservative friends Hillary ""won the popular vote,"" What good will that even do? The time for liberals to get better in-tune with the needs of the greater american conservative public has long since passed...",0
The fact that so many people still die of smoking deaths is unbelievable. With so much knowledge these days we should be able to educate people about the danger associated with smoking and change this pattern! And the fact that the WHO recommends taxation at 75 percent of retail cost and NO states do this is crazy!,0
"It seems like the premises of this arguement is so shaky. Just because Russia and Poland may have had tensions for a while, it does not justify that they assassinated the guy. I mean, if everyone just assumex their enemy is the result of their misfortune, they will just be creating false tension with no real purpose. I understand that he is upset for their lost, and that this was avoidable from bad weather and pilot control, but still.",0
"This shows how the current political environment is effecting people, especially younger people, emotionally. The stress and fear that is being shown from the younger generation is mostly to blame on social media. We used to be able to discuss political issues in person, calmly. Now, if you try to mention your opinion on social media, you run the risk of being attacked or insulted, simply adding to the fear of the current political situations.",0
Please hug your loved ones because they may be gone at any moments of time. If you were in an argument with any of them please reconsider what has happened in the past and let it go. Life is short and we all have only one life to live on this planet. We should all cherish each other and enjoy life to the fullest.,0
I had no idea that the Great Lakes area had problems with earthquakes. I'm glad that it wasn't a bigger on but it is still had how much damage was done. I feel better for those families that lost loved ones. You would think in this modern age we would be able to detect earthquakes sooner and have enough time to evacuate an area.,0
"This article highlights the fact that although we may have profound faith in the goodness of human nature, we never know when a killer is walking among us. The recent spate of mass shootings at schools and other locations underline the presence of disturbed people in our midst. Besides defending ourselves, we need to ask ourselves what in our society is provoking this disturbing behavior. Certainly the ubiquity and ease of acquiring guns is one cause, but there may be others that need attention as well.",0
"I still don't like Kim Jong-un, but he may be starting to realize that being cooperative and living peacefully is a better way of living and leading, rather than the aggressive, threatening leader he is trying to show us in the past. We may never know his real motives, but as long as North Korea cooperates and be a productive nation, then a lot of other countries will help them in times of need.",0
"If you are using trumps name to make him look bad is not the answer here. I know that trump is not being a good president right now but lets not discredit his success. Somebody burned a church that is not related to Donald Trump at all, lots of Families go to that church. I think someone used this attack as an attack to Donald Trump because he is not affiliated with this and makes people look like he caused this",0
"Yet another reason to have more strict immigration rules. These people know the dangers that they face when they do this, so it is hard to feel very sorry for them. I don't think giving them more information on these dangers will stop them, but patrolling the waters and turning these human traffickers back will. If it is made difficult for these human traffickers to exploit these people, it will happen less often.",0
"Can you believe they're doing this? Kicking people out of their homes to expand a stupid airport? Screw these guys. what do you think? Personally, I'm upset and I'm starting a petition. Please sign it if you're against this issue like I am. It's absolutely ridiculous and should never happen, so there you go",0
"This article was about a rash of fires in the south, particularly Appalachia. It mentioned dry conditions causing numerous fires and contributing to pollution that made the air dangerous and unpleasant to breathe. It also said that some of the fires were probably caused by arson, but didn't dwell too much on that aspect. The quoted official mentioned that dry conditions meant more fires could easily be accidentally started and that was a danger.",0
"What would we do without friends? Have you ever given it a thought? Friends are there, right by your side, through thick and thin, adding the right flavors to your life -- cheering you up when you're down, laughing with you till you're both on the floor clutching your stomachs, holding your hand when you're not strong enough to face the world... When you are blessed with true friends you can always count on, you can bravely face any storm and tackle obstacles with a smile.",0
"middle east is fucked up, I've honestly never heard of a middle east country such as Afganistan deporting people, the mention of it just sound funny, who the heck would want to stay in that shit hole country that has been infested with terrorists and child rapists? Perhaps those refugees are out of choice, honestly they should come to a better country such as U.S. or U.K, even though those 2 countries have their own policies regarding immigration, but I think they're quite tolerate to people from war torn countries",0
"So the police found this woman wondering the streets in Philadelphia at 1 am with no coat on in the cold. She was in some kind of daze, probably alzheimer's or something. Anyways, their trying to identify her. It would suck to be in that state of mind. Sounds horrible and potentially scary if your cognizant enough.",0
"Reading this was infuriating to me. To see such casual disregard for life, both of the animals and those protecting them, in pursuit of money. And for what? Snake oil cures in Asia, superstitious nonsense, and rich people wanting to feel powerful. The security teams seem like they're in an impossible position, restrained by rules while their opponents have none. It's a miserable situation",0
"Hey, Josh here is another example of total insanity in a nation that has taken millions of jobs from people around the world but refuses to give any serious consideration to the health and welfare of its citizens. These people are pawns and the sad thing is no one there has the will to fix any of the sanitation problems or air quality issues. What is so hard about it? Maybe they should start eating some of their relatives, you know, cattle.",0
"If you're here illegally, you shouldn't be here. I don't have much sympathy. Sure, if your parents brought you here, you didn't have much choice...but figure out how to be here legally. I don't have much sympathy for people here illegally. There are ways to do things right...and there are rules for a reason.",0
"This is no surprise. As with every year before it for the past couple decades, this was the hottest year on record. I do not know how so many people can take irrefutable scientific evidence like this and still not only question, but outright deny that global warming is happening. It makes me angry that we are killing this planet and there are so many people that are simply too stupid too admit it is happening and fix it.",0
After reading this story I think the right decision was made. It seems to me that the man had no reason to shoot at those kids just because they were playing loud music. Sure music can be annoying but no one deserves to be shot over it. I don't think that any changes need to be made to the stand your ground laws. This was a simple case of someone making poor choices and now needs to pay the price for their actions.,0
"These people were guests who were presumably staying illegally at this camp.  They were allowed to stay there out of compassion , I'm assuming.  Then, when they're told that something else has to be figured out, they lose it.  When you give a group something, even if it doesn't belong to them and even if you're being kind my doing it, they immediately feel like it belongs to them and will react strongly if you try to take it away.",0
"It is extremely upsetting that there is a cultural war going on and no one seems to care. The values of muslims in general are not compatible with western culture. Further more, it is an ideology that promotes violence and terrorism. Until people become less tolerant of this disgusting dogma, things like this will continue to happen. If muslims want to be viewed in a better light in the west, they need to work on reforming their religion from within.",0
i feel like we need to do somthing about this problem that is going on we dont need moms overdoseing on drugs plus doing it while they are driving. maybe there is a program we could start to help these mom in need and the kids that they have should be taken care by someone else while they are getting the help that they need to get better and then they can get there kids back when they are able to take care of them,0
"I feel bad for that baby. The way it sounds, especially with the bottle of milk being in there, it sounds like someone had the baby and couldn't keep it so they left it there. I wish people would use the fire station safe haven option. I thought it was interesting that they mentioned that a 14 year old heard the cries. I wonder if the 14 year old was the one who had the baby and had to hide it.",0
"Muslim immigration seems to have some unique issues.  I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.  I suspect some mental issues may not be helped by seeing a professional.",0
"Is it too much to ask for a judge that follows the Constitution? Check this article out and see if you agree. Focusing on fringe issues is not going to unite us. I wish we could move past this and leave people's personal beliefs out of it and focus only on the law. that would be nice for a change, woudln't it?",0
"It's ridiculous that those talk shows of daytime tv moved on to be more like soap opera's. They could have done alot of good for their fans, but then it just became more of a cheap laugh. The people that lost their jobs on Sally Jesse Raphael had families they supported. After being told the show would be renewed, it was a harsh blow to find out that wasn't the case. I feel for those that were put out of work.",0
"To show with how it can be done and understanding with how others are making sure that I'm not making sure, which of these things are becoming worse and how it's not being told with how the private message isn't being shown. I believe that it can't be how my friend is, because it's just not important and with it being bad, it's just not really good.",0
"While reading this, I can't help but think about how much of politics nowadays is about money. How many millions of dollars is spent trying to convince people that someone is a good person and right for the job. It should be like any other position. Work hard. Do good. Build a resume you can be proud of  and let that speak for itself!",0
I cant believe how some countries treat criminals. I agree that they should be punished and face consequences but beating them to death is definitely excessive especially when the crime is not that bad. I'm not sure how that helps the crime rates and I definitely dont think we should consider that method where we come from.,0
"Just read an article that explored Trump's appeal and why he won the election.  It indicated that Trump had a simple appeal to the darker side of people, the look out for myself and not others side, it explored Trump's ability to partner with those that are hurting and feel left out of society through lack of jobs, etc.  He used this association to promote his agenda, with simple phrases that were easy to remember, and tailored it to the good old boy network.  The article didn't really explore Russia's influence on the election, only addressed Trump's appeal to certain groups.",0
"Tourist who claimed she was raped in Dubai is charged with extramarital sex — A British tourist allegedly raped by two men in Dubai faces jail after cops accused her of sex outside marriage. The woman, 25, claims she was attacked by two U.K. men last month. But when she reported it, she was locked up and charged with “extramarital sex”. She is on bail but is not allowed to leave and needs $30,000 for legal fees.",0
"The fact that this article shows the global gender gap not being equal until 2196 is particularly disturbing.  And, I wonder why women have dropped out of the workforce globally?  I mean, I did drop out but only after 30 years of employment.  It seems as if, in this day and age, you'd hear that women's participation in the workforce had increased, not decreased.",0
"Kind of cool that researchers  have found that bonobos tend to become farsighted as they age, which is quite similar to humans. They also observed their grooming practices. Some even take turns grooming one another, which is pretty cool. The article was extremely hard to read and understand, especially with it being written in one giant block, so those are really the only key points I got from it.",0
"That is nice. Isis is using Chemical Weapons against us now? What is the world coming to, and how much longer are we going to put our military out there for this? Especially now that they are being exposed to chemicals that can burn the skin, and due some bad damage. This doesn't doesn't seem right at all.",0
"Hey you, I found more information about that woman who overdosed in the car with her infant.  It is just horrible.  From what I am reading it happened in Indiana and she had a syringe in her hand.  Her poor baby was only 10 months old.  How sad.  They were parked outside of a Dollar General when thankfully someone noticed and called 911.  The grandmother got guardianship over the baby, thank goodness.  The women got booked on neglect and possession, hopefully she stays in there for awhile.",0
"I think protests these days are getting out of hand. It's one thing if people want to protest peacefully, but it's another if they are damaging property and being aggressive and dangerous. I believe people should have a right to protest, but some laws must be in place. If you can't follow them there will need to be consequences.",0
"It's ridiculous that this day in age and for such an advanced country, we can't even get water right. It should be a priority that a basic necessity for life be safe. If we can't do water right, how can we do anything else right? It's a freaking joke. Our whole governmental system is a mess. And yet, no one does anything.",0
"Here's another article from the 2016 campaign that didn't age well. Read it and have a laugh. It's pretty ridiculous in retrospect. More of the women they're talking about voted for Trump than Hillary. I guess they never asked women if those allegations bothered them or were important. I know that you told me after the Access Hollywood tapes that you didn't care about that stuff, that policy issues were more important.",0
"She lost my sympathy really quick. Seems like she likes attention. This does make me look at Paris differently. These all seem like inside jobs. I would be safe there. But, I still don't plan on visiting. Not a fan of people endorsing candidates in countries that they can not vote. Seems like an ego thing.",0
"Now a days for money people are doing anything, school children to make addict of porn websites and make porn video from them, i will tell one incident. The former elementary school volunteer accused of producing child pornography involving students as young as 9 has been indicted on two additional sex.  The Guy Deonte Carraway, 23, of Glenarden, now faces a total of 15 federal counts of sexual exploitation of a minor to produce child pornography. The federal charges are separate from local charges that Carraway faces in Prince George’s County, where a local grand jury indicted him on 270 counts of sex crimes and child pornography involving 23 children as young as 9 years old.",0
"This does not surprise me. The people on RHONY are kind of trashy. So, it is not hard to believe they were married to a person who would do something like this. It does not really sound like a big deal either. He could have done much worse. Did she even lose money because of this? I would guess not.",0
"This feels so typical. The burden of safe sex has fallen to the woman for decades, ever since the oral contraceptive was introduced. Women frequently have to decide between accepting disturbing side effects or accepting the risk of pregnancy, whereas men have never had to make that choice. There will never be true equality until men and women face the risks and consequences of sex equally.",0
"Wow, I just read an article describing the problems Venezuela is having with its new leader.  About 80% of the people are dissatisfied with his leadership and want him out.  But there isn't a smooth process put into place for that.  Even the Vatican is trying to assist, but to no avail so far.  I can't help but think of all the problems the US has lately, but we do have a constitution and a system for change.  I am not sure how Venezuela will fix things peacefully, and how its citizens will fare through all this.  The article made comparisons with Cuba, and previous leadership, but I did not fine a clear solution.",0
"The whole situation with Iraq and the uprising of ISIS can be attributed to the U.S. War on Terror and failed attempts at establishing democracy in the Middle East. The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.",0
I really don't fully understand what's happening in this article. I get that the players need sleep and that's about it. Do you know much about what they're trying to say here? I have such little knowledge of sports that I struggle understanding the lingo associated with the sport. I can understand sleep though!,0
"So I just read this article about rappers and music artists having a disagreement. It was pretty stupid too, I don't get why adults are fighting like high school children. It was all over some petty comments made, which apparently turned to racist slurs and got someone thrown out fo a building. Of course, everything is he said she said so I can't tell who was really wrong in this situation. However, again another situation that shows the stupidity of the human race.",0
"Dude, there is some pretty messed up stuff going on. I feel like every time I turn on the news or open a newspaper I am reading about pedophilia going on all over the world. I feel like it is much more common than anyone realizes and that at any given moment, I could be walking past someone who is sexually attracted to children. It is crazy to think about and really scary.",0
I just read an article about a mother and father that sexually abused their daughter from the age of 11. It is just disgusting. I can't imagine how in the world someone would be okay doing this to their child. Those parents deserve a fate worse than death. What is WRONG with people? They deserved to be tortured until the day they die. So disgusting.,0
another case of government not working like it should.  one should have effective recourse without having to hire an attorney and spend thousands of dollars to straighten things out.  it makes me angry because i know how easily it could happen to me.  why people can't do their jobs and/or show some empathy in this situation is beyond my comprehension.  i sure hope this does not happen to me or you.,0
"It's sad these days how often police are being attacked for just being police.  Mental health is such a problem, we need to find better ways to help people so they don't get to the point of harming others.  Whenever I hear about an officer being hurt I think of your husband.  We are very lucky men like him are choosing to spend their lives to protect us.  I hope we can get help to more people so I can stop worrying if there is someone out there waiting for him.",0
"This is so sad, but I think it had a lot to do with a bunch of college kids drinking and partying, and then something going terribly wrong.  I think there was a group of kids that started arguing with the guy and one got pretty riled up and hit the guy.  I find it interesting that there were things that were not being commented on.  I think there's a lot more to this story than what the school is reporting.",0
"I think these people ahve been fighting each other over tribalism and ideology since I can remember. Im talking about Iraq, which is dividing into 3 main groups who have competed for limited resources for a long time. And the wealth of oil taken by the leaders and not shared with prosperity for all people has increased tensions. When I was young it was Iraq Iran War, the Saddam Hussein reign of terror, then the First Gulf War, the the Second Iraq War, then ISIS. THese people have something wrong with them and I think they bear some responsibility for their own suffering.",0
"Again it's all about the money. Corporate America strikes again. They leech as much money from the working class as possible as they sit in their office, finger banging their secretary. When their lies and misdirection is revealed, some fat cat takes the blame (along with millions of dollars of hush money, and the working class is thrown to the wolves and blamed for most of the misdeeds.",0
"Did you know that Climate Change Threatens the  World’s Coffee Supply?? A report I read about a report says thinking of the many ways climate change threatens coffee and coffee farmers has alarmed people who are now imagining what it would be like getting through the day without their caffeine fix! Well, it certainly is concerning to me! The report, released this month, was commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand supposedly the hub of the global Fairtrade system. I guess it doesn’t contain much new research, but still it has made waves by collating an array of available literature suggesting that climate change will have a major effect on the world’s coffee supply. Well, knowing how you love your coffee just as much as I do, I just knew this would fascinate you! Tell everyone!!",0
"Wow, a teacher get pregnant after having sex numerous times with an 8th grader pleads guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated sexual assault of a child. This is unreal and aggravates me that teachers would do this and children would go along with it. The world needs to worry less about wants, quit being emotionally and physically weak and focus on needs, not wants. This whole story iis pathetic and all involved have ruined their own lives and for what, pleasure? They're all weak.",0
"Wow. So... I sure as fuck do not have that much to say about that stupid article / news story. But, I guess that I'll try to think of something. It's also not at all something that I would share or want to share with anyone that I know. It's not relevant to me or the people that I know and care about. It's not something that I would just choose to read either. Ok. Have you seen this article about the dad that killed his daughter's molester? Apparently she was molested when she was young, the guy went to jail for a year and a half and was let out. Many years later, the dad went and shot the guy. That's pretty much it. I don't know why I'm sending this to you, but what do you think? I think that it was boring and I wasn't interested in it at all.",0
"I was with him and mildly supportive of him until I found out about the second shooting. You can't just go shooting everybody who had every treated your daughter wrong.  My initial thought was, oh the justice system failed and this guy had it coming.  Then after reading about the second incident, I'm starting to feel like this was more a crazy guy on a shooting spree.",0
"I just read this article about a murder suicide. This couple, their three kids, and their dog were all dead from gunshot wounds. They even shot the dog. :( The family seemed really normal. They had some issues with stress and the relationship, but who doesn't? It's really eerie that people can be like that and you won't even know it.",0
the person that rented out the appartment i feel was in the wrong doing because they didnt own the place so when the damages came it he wasnt able to fix the problems making it the owners problem which led to them finding out and having to file the law suite for 20k to get there money back so it was a messy situtation,0
There has been uprisings in Ethiopia.  Looks like many people aren't happy with the industrialization and foreign investments taking place there.  People had axes and sounded like a pretty serious event that may continue.  Foreign investors are taking notice and may rethink their investments there or in the future.  Really don't think of foreign investments in ethipoia but I guess there is.,0
Supposedly there is a lot of unrest in Ethiopia right now over the appropriation of land and government protest. I thought they were doing well and the economy was growing but i guess it has ceased now. Its unbelievable that all this is going on and most people in the states are aware of whats going on.,0
"Ugh - can you believe this story? First - why not just go to the doctor? Don't be shy, it's your dick we're talking about. Then, why insert a chopstick SO FAR THAT YOU COULDN""T GET IT OUT. Holy crap, that sounds awful. I am totally shocked to read this and can only imagine the pain - but then again, he did bring it upon himself.",0
"It's not pleasant to think of these animals being mistreated, but for all the problems in the world something like this seems rather minor. Of course it would be great to ensure good keeping of animals, but there are more pressing tragedies happening much more often to human beings that we should focus on before addressing these issues of occasional animal mis-handling.",0
"I feel bad for the victims of this murderer, they did nothing wrong to be attacked during their everyday life, they were innocent. I'm extremely angry with the neo nazi murderer, he was an egoist and I'm mad with the gun control laws that allow people with ""metal health problems"" to easily purchase guns.",0
I think its so scary that there have been shark attacks in Australia's beaches. I wouldn't want to be a surfer there knowing that anytime my life could be in danger since you don't know what your surfing under whether its a huge shark preying on you waiting to strike and make you his fresh meal. I am always cautious when I'm in the water since people don't realize there are so many dangers deciding to get into the water.,0
"As I read this article, I felt a bit nervous and alarmed at India's tiger population, even though this is in India but still. Hopefully, the Tigers will be better protected in the future and people will stop trying to kill them or dial it down at least. I wish India's tigers the best in their protection and survival.",0
The problem of poaching has become such an epidemic guides in South Africa who use to take hunters on big game safari's are now becoming a different kind of hunter themselves. They've taken up arms in the war on poaching due to the fact it is an outrageous epidemic at this point. Animals like the rhino are on the brink of extinction and poachers don't care.,0
It's a shame how troubled the middle east is and has been for the longest time.  I wish we could come to some agreement with the rest of the world on how to realistically handle the multiple situations in the middle east.  I feel that we should pull out and let them handle their problems on their own with only some guidance from us.,0
"So, in India there's a lot of corruption and the Prime Minister made a promise to stop it. He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks. I agree!",0
"Cricket players in England are likely going to have trouble sleeping after a 4th day of the first Test. Being in their shoes, playing hard and working together is the key to beating Bangladesh and they need to stay on top of their game in order to win. While it's physically demanding, giving up or blaming lack of sleep is simply not an option for the team.",0
"Being interested in sports and health together, this is a solid article showing the impact eye injuries have on different types of sports. It's somewhat common to see these injuries present themselves in basketball, baseball, and sports without protective gear. That's just the nature of sports where consequences happen.",0
"It's sad that there are still outbreaks of cholera and other diseases that are easily preventable with sanitation and access to clean drinking water. If we all pitch in just a couple dollars, the cost of buying a bottle of water, I bet we could make a significant contribution to the relief effort in Yemen.",0
"The article I read was about the disparity in responsibility for birth control between men and women. A new male birth control was rejected as having too many side effects on men, when options available to women have far more and more severe side effects. The article mentioned that birth control for women revolutionized lives so much that the side effects were deemed acceptable, but men are not accustomed to ceding convenience for responsibility, are used to women taking control in this area.",0
"I feel sorry for this person's family. His children now have no father. You just never know what makes people commit terrible acts of evil. Life can be taken in the blink of an eye. You need to make sure all your loved ones know how much you care, do as much good in the world as you can, because you never know when your last day on this earth is going to be.",0
"This is another example of the racism in this country, the officers again use extreme deadly force against a black person, just because he was black, he was not a threat and yet they shot him without hesitation. We feel more insecure with officers around than safe, and still they can kill people and get away with it.",0
I honestly cant remember what i read. I walked away for a drink and came back and i completely forgot. Reading these articles like this in succession is tedious and makes the stories asll run together making the retention of the story hard to keep. I would have reread the article if i could and there was an option to,0
There are all these people protesting on both sides of this issue but where were many of these people at the voting booths?? If everyone who is so against Trump came out and voted maybe we wouldn't be in this situation in the first place!! And all the people who voted for third party candidates know that you contributed to this as well because you threw away your vote!,0
"Like I have said before and will say it till I am blue in the face. I hate Donald Trump. He is not progressing the United States of America forward. He says his new slogan is Keep America Great, well, buddy, you got to make it great in the first place. He is one racist, misogynistic, egotistical liar and cannot wait till he leave, however way.",0
"I just read this crazy article about Wells Fargo that I thought I would share with you. It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money. Then its the workers getting fired.",0
"Well that sucks for this people in the south.  It seems like there's always something that's messing with the gas prices.  Hopefully they'll get it repaired soon though and things will go back to normal. At least there wasn't severe environmental damage, that's a good thing. If I were down there, I would probably just ride a bike for a few weeks.",0
Terribly sorry for all the families affected by this incident. I confident that the Russians had something to do with this. They interfered with our election too. They are corrupt and shady. This further demonstrates that you can't trust the Russians. I'm so done with them. I'm not sure what needs to be done but I wish Putin disappeared from this Earth.,0
This story makes me sick to my stomach.  I hate reading things about where my food comes from.  It's bad enough to know that i am eating an animal but to know it suffered makes it worse.  While the story is about the the suffering of an animal at the end of it's life it seems to ignore the suffering that the chicken goes through 99.9% of the time it is alive.  This kind of story makes me want to go vegan.,0
I think we should just leave them where they are. They're not causing any problems. They're too dangerous and too costly to try to move. There hasn't been great reports of them starving. They should be fine to roam around there for now. We don't want to waste tax dollars to try to deal with a dangerous situation.,0
"The liberal left has struck again. They continue to react negatively to Trump being president even 18 months after the election. This whole thing about getting an IUD now because Trump will make birth control unaffordable in the near future is ridiculous. Just another issue to get people stirred up. Most Trump supporters are conservative when it comes to economic issues but moderately liberal when it concerns social issues. Big changes in birth control, same sex marriages, abortion, and women’s rights are not going to happen. I would like to ask the haters how their lives have changed for the worse since the election!",0
"Since I have no children and don't plan on having any, I don't really have an opinion regarding the ease that women choose to have cesarean instead of natural births. I don't think my opinion would be well received and I myself know I have no experience in this. I do believe, however, that a woman should look at all available options and decide what is best for her and her family.",0
"I guess people don't realize how much of an impact they can have.  The article says if people would have done something they could have stopped the extinction of the animals.  But at the same time, it is people's action indirectly that caused the extinction, through contributing to climate change.  There is so much that can go out of balance in nature when people are involved.  When one species dies off, then everything in that ecosystem changes.  I guess the article was kind of interesting.  But what is the solution the problem they are talking about?  How should people intervene to save those animals?",0
Why am I so ignorant when it comes to politics. I just reread an article 3 times over to try and figure out what it was talking about with Trump and jobs and discrimination and racism by the end of it all three times I felt like I had read gibberish. Is that how politics are for you or do you actually understand it. All I understand is that I don't agree with Trump I don't agree with his Antics I don't agree with his policies. I'm not sure if he's selfish or just a moron right now. How do you feel?,0
"I can't believe what's going on overseas. It's so tragic that people in the military are still dying in war, and for what? I thought they would be gone from there by now but they're not. And there's still issues with kidnappings and things of that nature. It's really quite shocking when you think about it.",0
"These are problems that US solider had to deal with for many year. Hell, you could even go back much, much further if you want to. War is hell, and it can--and often does--do a ringer to your psyche and overall mental health. That's why we as a society need to pump more resources into mental health as we do physical health.",0
"Seems like a pretty ordinary occurrence. I'm sure their families are upset but I'm less sure this kind of story deserves space in a newspaper. A couple people got sick and they died. Anyway, it's a mildly sad story but it's not noteworthy or newsworthy. I don't understand why stories like this run in the paper.",0
"The article was quite eye opening for someone who may not be extremely into politics.  The confederate flag seems to somehow have different meanings to different people, which I never really understood.  To get upset because the flag was being hung in college campuses, makes sense to me.  I would get upset as well.  For students to be afraid for their welfare and or they education at their college because of President elect Trump, also makes sense to me.  The whole campaign seems to be one big controversy.",0
hopefully you did not go through much reading this particular messade unfortuanetly this happens everyday and people throw vbnlind eyes tro the situation because no one wants to deal with this kind ofstuff but i am presenting this tuff to you so you guys can acknowldge it and be awareof it and be a little more bit educated about stuff liek this and so on,0
"I am a little confused as to how these hacks happen, but it sucks when they do. I am a Yahoo user and think they have had to take precautionary measures multiple times in recent years to stop issues. Data breaches are troubling and can affect us all so I am not happy about the article's details that make me somewhat nervous.",0
"It's about time somebody stood up to Mexico.  We are being flooded with mexicans and immigrants flooding over the border.  It's an invasion as far as I'm concerned.  I could go into detail about all the negatives it causes.  But what I am sick of is every time we want to do something about it,  all the naysayers and doomsdayers through NAFTA and Trade and economics in our face.  I get it we made some dumb deals in the past that have lead to bad consequences,  but we elected Trump to take a new direction.  Mexico will have to get their act together too,  I'm sick of them acting like saints everytime we want to take an action.",0
"So, I had to read an article about somebody named Kylie Jenner, and evidently she has some sort of makeup line or something. Anyway, evidently she must be popular for some reason, because people are making counterfeit cosmetics and selling them as her brand. She put out some message about how you should only buy direct from her website. I guess a sucker is born every minute.",0
"Can't believe the jury failed to convict the people involved in the National Wildlife Refuge takeover in Oregon. The people weren't even from Oregon. They traveled half way across the country, invaded the facility, and barricaded themselves inside. Yet the jury didn't find reasonable cause to believe they impeded Wildlife Service workers from doing their jobs. Bunch of alt-right would-be cowboys.",0
"I don't understand how people can look at stories like this and still claim that ""guns don't kill people, people kill people"". If guns were less available and less prevalent in communities prone to violence, then confrontations between people would be far less likely to be lethal. It needs to be more difficult to obtain a firearm in this country.",0
I hate ISIS. They are a group full of hate and insanity. There is no reason for them to be doing the things they do. They make people suffer and die for no reason at all. They think they are better than other people and should be disbanded. I do not think there is room in this world for people that associate with them and they are highly misguided. I cannot respect them at all.,0
"I just recently read an article about the drought out in the West. I had heard about the lack of water supply in California but I hadn't heard anything at all about the suffering in Nevada also.  It seems that lots of Nevadians, especially the Native Americans who own land there are in trouble from the lack of water.  With everything dying, it is difficult for them to keep animals alive.  Is it also causing problems in families. Who would think that lack of water would be the cause of violence, abuse, and neglect. Such a sad article.",0
"I just read this article about how Canada actually had school where they would force indigenous people of their land to go.  They tried to erase their history , and their language.  I always thought canada was such a peaceful country.  These people were even experimented on, and the school was still in operation up until 1996!, That is astonishing.  I thought, we , americans, were the only ones who forced the indigenous people away, or tried to kill their culture.  This just shows you that people are pretty much the same, and pretty much were savages, until recently.  Even now though, we still have a long way to go, until we reach a place where everyones culture and differences are celebrated, and not shamed, and destroyed",0
"I tend to be very hard-hearted when it comes to issues of immigration. Yet this is a man for who all intents and purposes is an American, raised here from the age of three and facing deportation for missed paperwork? This is quite frankly a steaming pile of bullshit. There are those who come here, infest neighborhoods and take away jobs from hard working Americans and then there are victims of bureaucratic anarcho-tyranny like this. These types of scenarios are unacceptable.  I tend to believe that a system that will let the guilty go free is preferable to one that will punish even one innocent man. Men like this deserve to be treated as Americans, because they are.",0
"I just read an article about Susan Sarandon asking people to put their money where their mouth is in regards to the Dakota Access Pipeline. While I don't agree with her position, I do agree with that statement. If people want to whine about it, they should step up and help instead of crying on social media.",0
"The company behind ITT Technical Institute, the chain of for-profit schools in the United States, will shut down all of its campuses following financial sanctions from the U.S. Department of Education. ITT Educational Services said in a statement Tuesday it would shutter more than 130 locations in 39 states. The move affects hundreds of thousands of current students and more than 8,000 employees of the ITT Technical Institute, known colloquially as ITT Tech, the company said. “It is with profound regret that we must report that ITT Educational Services, Inc. will discontinue academic operations at all of its ITT Technical Institutes permanently after approximately 50 years of continuous service,” it said in a statement on its website. A day later, ITT announced it would not enroll any new",0
"I just read about a car crash in Prince Georges County, near Clinton. It involved three vehicles and it happened at the tail end of rush hour. It said that one woman was critically injured, but I wonder if the passengers in the other two vehicles were injured. Maryland drivers suck. I avoid anywhere near DC since the roads are not conducive to safe driving.",0
We need to destroy the system that allows these things to happen. Capitalism that reinforces these disgusting habits must be destroyed utterly and the Christian religion should be wiped out in its entirety. There is no excuse for this kind of repulsive behavior that drives people to abuse these children.,0
"Wow.. You have to check this out.  There was a horrible accident on a family type Water Ride in Gold Coast Austrailia.  4 People were killed..2 women ages 42 and 32 I think, also two men, 38, and 35,.  This is what happened...2 people were ejected from the raft and the other 2 were trapped inside..they all died.  The park was shut down.  The thing that makes it wierd is that the water feature is like a tame family type ride..Definately things families would go on together. Makes you think Right?",0
I am shocked and saddened by this earthquake. What a sad and terrible tragedy. I feel so sorry for all the victims and those affected by this event. I can't even imagine how devastating this must be for them. What an incredible catastrophe. My thoughts and prayers and best wishes go out for all the many people affected by this tragic catastrophe. I hope that everyone stays safe for the foreseeable future. I am still in shock.,0
"I said Trump would win. Polls said otherwise, I didn't care, I knew the fucker would win. I think people are not willing to accept that others are really shitty and that someone like Trump would be voted in. They can't see past others. People have too much faith in others, too much trust. There are a lot of vile people out there, just gotta encourage them a little bit and they'll come out. Trump was their encouragement. What will the liberals do now? I don't know. Sometimes I think we will be okay, sometimes I think we won't. I just know that going to one march is going to do shit. You need tens of marches, packed to the brim. You need them every weekend. For months. You need to call your officials, complain, elect them, vote them out. Do more. But one march isn't going to do shit.",0
India just confirmed its participation in the Paris Climate Accord. I think it's great that the larger countries of the world are willing to step in and say that things need to change. I also really like that they made the announcement on Gandhi's birthday. I think that's a nice and respectful way to honor his legacy.,0
"I'm not sure what the  gay community hoped to accomplish by holding a gay pride event in a country where homosexuality is illegal. It's not like people there ignore such a law, since someone was powerful enough to criminalize sexual preference in the first place. I think I would rather stay under the radar until I could find a more tolerant place to live.",0
"I've seen the Slager video, he needs to be in prison.  As far as Tensig goes, that's a tough call. Moral of the story is, don't give a man with a gun any reason to be afraid of you.The traffic stop went the direction it did because of DuBose's actions.I have a hard time feeling sympathy for someone who makes horrible decisions that result in predictable outcomes.",0
"Environmentalism at its core is a racket. The leaders will use whatever methods to tie nature together to guilt you into accepting higher and higher taxes towards cost of living while majority of this money goes towards these non-profit organizations that help them push thier agenda. These environmental groups are only capable of gutting thier own people and will not address the larger oil buyers such as China or any other third world nation that is burning coal. By raising the cost of oil isn't going to stop Saudi Arabia or Russia from pumping oil, its all a racket to control the power supply and tax the people.",0
"Some people are just disturbed. Everyone is going to point to mental illness in something like this, but I fear that when things like this happens, it gets easier and easier just to point at people and call them mentally ill. I fear that eventually we are going to get to the point where you can classify someone as mentally ill by the crowd. Just finger pointing. I feel for these victims and the victims of crimes in the future because we spend too much time making excuses and pointing fingers rather than dealing with the problems at hand.",0
"i was reading about the war in Iraq. not gonna lie, i couldnt read it all. logically you know ""war is hell"" but all the details of it were too much for me. i tried, but reading of who's got a head head injury, who got gassed, it was too much. I flinch when i hear the words ""suicide bomber"" on the news, so reading about people being dragged into the city to be used as human sheilds was too much. I dont get it. how can people be so horrible to each other. bomb and attacks require calculated effort i just  cant comprhend.",0
"How disgusting is Wells Fargo? It's unbelievable the way they treated their tellers, and all those fake accounts? Can you even? I don't understand how this bank doesn't get shut down. You really should think about getting an account with a different bank, you know. What if your SS got used to make some of those accounts?",0
Whenever kids are involved in a nasty breakup there are never any winners. The person who gets the short end of the stick in this case will probably be the child who will be forced to split time and maybe even countries between the two parents. People should try and consider the child's feelings before using them as pawns in a custody fight.,0
"Hey, check this out. This guy ended up murdering his wife for no obvious ad apparent reason, according to this article. He was happily married to his wife and just ended up committing a homicide. It's scary to think about, how it could be possible for someone to just go off like that and kill someone they love.",0
"Here is an article that pretty much sums up what most people already know about Donald Trump and his campaign platform.  This is highlights some of the main points, including his stances on immigration, abortion rights, gun rights, Comey, the Clintons, and a variety of other topics.  It's a good refresher.",0
"This is so sad.  Today I read about a lady who passed away November 6th and had shared many of her stories of her experiences in the holocaust.  IT's very sad to think there aren't many people left to share these stories.  I remember being in Junior high and hearing someone speak about it, and to think kids these days will never get that.  Thankfully, there are museums for people to attend to hear and get closer to what truly happened back then.",0
"I read an article about the Loud Music Shooter, not sure if you've heard about this case in Florida.  It seems like they've upheld the murder conviction for the man who shot a black teen during an argument about loud music being played.  It did seem more like murder and not so much like an actual self-defense situation.",0
How can people take something like relationships for granted? It's infuriating that in a world where I have to fight for the right to marry the person I love and adore and want to pamper and cherish and share a life with that there are assholes out there like this with anger issues who will get in their alleged partner's face and shout. The hate is just mind blowing.,0
"So, I just read an article that I have absolutely no interest in. It was a bunch of gossip about Val Kilmer's health, as if that is newsworthy. I'm not even sure why I read the whole thing. I gained nothing in the way of knowledge by reading this article. What a waste of time! People really should learn how to mind their own business.",0
A priest was abducted and tortured in Mexico.  Authorities think it was a robbery but the church is convinced it was due to him being a human rights activist.  It sucks that it happened but in all fairness Mexico is a shit hole and well known for cartel actions such as this.  How many of your peers have to get abducted and killed or tortured before you learn to shut the fuck up or get the fuck out?  In the end nobody but themselves to blame.,0
"What are we going to do, start collecting cow farts? That sounds like a good job to me. I bet the benefits are good. I guess the liberals will try to blame meat eaters for this some how. I mean, maybe we can develop some kind of methane collection system and then use the cow farts to power the world. Talk about renewable energy!",0
"I am rather turned off by the fact that California allows the water supply to be so construed for people. Very sad to see people in central California go through what Flint, Michigan went through with poor water conditions and I'd hate to be in the political sphere there. It would be good to see organizations working within the region to bring residents quality water.",0
"I feel that we are prioritizing efforts of saving the planet in the wrong way. We want to ban this or that, and that's great and all. However, we are missing the bigger picture. We need to focus on building a world that co exists with nature, instead of just saving little bits of it here and there. While some strive to save this or that, there are a million other things destroying it further. We need to end the destruction of our global ecosystem, and not pick and choose species to save. Other wise there will be nothing left, and those efforts would have been in vein.",0
I understand why this is a problem but I don't see any reason to get upset over it. It seemed like they were writing about it with more emotion than the situation deserves. Trees die all the time. They're replaced by something else. It's extremely common. I get that it's worth given current climate conditions but still.,0
"Hey, man, don't know if you saw this report on the news, but this article is pretty messed up.  Those poor people were just trying to have a good time and then all hell broke lose.  I remember seeing the news reports and the images were pretty shocking, but the story in this article takes it to another level.  You should read it.  These poor people are going to get paid for sure.  it is funny how the owner had to invoke ""God"" trying to protect his own ass.",0
"I just read the article and I am so surprised that this happened. I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad. Crowe also doesn't seem like the kind of person to be racist or to bully someone for absolutely no reason, either.",0
"I just read an article about America's refugee problem, that talked about the Somali community in Minneapolis. I can't believe the emotional language they tried to use in the article; it just makes me sick to see any reporting that doesn't only concern the facts, with no editorializing by the author. I wish that everyone who decided to become a writer would learn that there is no place for opinion in the news.",0
I didn't realize that a dam could cause so much problem.  It is a shame that the people who are going to be impacted the most are the indigenous people.  I don't understand how people feel it is okay to do this to them.  Maybe there are many pros that I just don't know about and this article is focusing only on the negative of the methylmercury.  I guess this goes to show that we as a human race can affect the environment in maybe a not so good way.  What do you think about this?  I am curious what you have to say about this.,0
"I'm not a fan of Muslim migrants myself. I find most of Arab culture backwards and antithetical to American values. This is pretty fucked up, though. This article feels like something out of the 1960s. Makes you consider the cyclical and incremental nature of human history. Despite our technological advances we fall prey to the same prejudices and biases again and again. Before we were burning Native Americans, then the Irish, then Blacks, and now Muslims. Human progress at work.",0
Did you hear that some kids in another country are passing out in school because they do not have enough to eat?  The school can not do much or wont due to lack of funding.  Over 35% of kids do not even go to school because of lack of food causing some effect.  That is so sad.  I am glad that our government has different programs instilled to prevent that.,0
"This is a perfect example of why we need cameras everywhere.  They have this guy on video doing all the bad things he would do.  There is no way anyone can make any excuses for him now.  They will surely try, though.   BLM will probably come up with some story about how he was an upstanding citizen or something we have already heard before.",0
"This was an interesting article. I am a supporter of capital punishment, yet I find lethal injection to be absolutely ridiculous. It costs an insane amount of money just to execute somebody with this method, when a few bullets for less than a couple dollars would do the job just as well if not better.",0
We need to be more responsible with our wilderness areas! It is alarming that no one wants to talk about how these areas are being destroyed by development and can never be returned to their original wilderness states. Can you imagine a world in which our children can never go camping or hiking in the wilderness because it has all been destroyed and turned into buildings??,0
I’m so tired of Republicans. They never compromise. They want it their way. They never meet in the middle or half way. The government is a joke and can’t get a thing done because of the divide in parties. Democrats are willing to meet in the middle but it doesn’t matter because conservatives will only have one way.,0
"The article was about smokers and the prevalence of cancer among cigarette smokers. It indicated that the tobacco lobby results in weak tobacco control and a low effort among politicians to try and stop people from smoking. Quite frankly, I'm not sure why I should care about smokers. The evidence is there for them to see, yet they persist in their bad habits. Government can only do so much and it makes little sense for me to worry about another person's health when they are consciously making the decision to kill themselves.",0
"This story makes me feel upset and aggravated because I hate that it is so easy to obtain guns in this country. I truly believe that there is no reason for anyone to have a gun and wish that the laws would change to make this the case, so I always feel frustrated reading about random shootings. I hate that we are subject to everyone else's violent whims as long as they can easily purchase a gun, so that makes me feel angry and also worried. I also feel sort of exhausted, since this happens in the news so much it just feels like yet another shooting story I have to be aware of, it's tiring.",0
"Sadly this has become common in our society. Blacks are killed by police, and nothing seems to make a difference or matter. I can guarantee that if it was a black cop killing a while person, the outcomes would be entirely different. I dont blame the black community for their anger and dissapointment. I'm angry and dissapointed I cant imagine how they must feel.",0
"I'm glad that the officers that responded to the scene did not get hurt. I am also happy that the loose Emu did not get hurt. This is a hard article to write about. I wish that all police calls ended with a happy ending like this story where everybody gets to go home. I wish the worlds problems where as simple as an escaped emu on the loose. I believe that most police officers are kind and good nature and want to do the right thing, like helping this emu, but they are human and with any humans you will have some bad ones. Once again just happy nobody got hurt.",0
I think there are way to many people watching CNN in this country. They need to grow up. People are way to sensitive. We can not walk around on egg shells worrying about if we are going to offend someone. People will say mean things. People will hurt your feelings. grow up and get over it. Don't let it bother you. These people do not rule your life. You do!,0
"Climate change is already evident in all the ecosystems of the earth. the genes of living beings are changing in response to climate changes, affecting ecosystems around the world. the changes that by natural means should take a hundred of decades to occur, takes very few years to complete. This disorder affects the whole relationship of the ecosystems, discouraging them and causing their extinction.",0
"Now a days crime rate increased and now no safe for Muslim religion on USA, the american's doing something fishy and wanted. on New York city A Muslim woman’s clothing was set on fire while she walked down New York City’s Fifth Avenue, the police suspected a man who is standing with lighter and who ran away.",0
