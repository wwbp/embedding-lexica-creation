"Overall the abacus is wonderful, and my daughter and son seem to enjoy playing with it, but I was disappointed to find that this toy was actually made in China, not America as I thought.  I purchased the abacus from Melissa and Doug believing that they are an American company that makes their toys in America.  I was disappointed to read the label that stated it was made in China.",1
"For those who enjoy dice rolling games (like King of Tokyo) and also want to combine the Cthulhu mythos for a cooperative fight against Ancient Ones, this game fits the bill. Theoretically can play 1-8, but shines best with 1-4 given the potential downtime between turns since players take turns alternately instead of simultaneously.",1
used 4 of these to help me create a DIY lego play table for my kid. Saved a few hundred bucks with this,1
"For anyone who likes board games, miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular, this is a great, fun, simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The B Wing adds some awesome capabilities to the game and really kicks but in play!",1
"My son received this table when he was 8 months old, and still plays with it on an almost daily basis.  The legs are detachable, I guess so it can be placed on the floor for babies, but we never did that...  This table helped our son into a standing position, and encouraged him to &quot;cruise&quot;. The variety of music it provides is great, and hasn't even begun to get old yet (even for mom &amp; dad). Now at almost 2, I've noticed that my son is starting to make his own music instead of just &quot;pressing buttons&quot; .  Pressing the drums, the piano, then back to the drums... I'm sure this table will last for years to come, especially once he becomes more interested in his letters, numbers, and colors. I would DEFINITELY recommend this product for EVERY child!",1
"I really like this game. It is simple. We can vary the rules a bit if we like. Our 2.5-year-old loves to get the monsters. And the game goes by fast. I can even play it a few times before I tell them I'm done.Small gripe: those beds are too big for the bags. Maybe a different, smaller shape could have been used in its place. Tiniest gripe ever. We love this game.",1
"We bought this toy at Christmas for our then 8-month-old twins. The &quot;leader&quot; twin took to it right away, loving the blocks and the sounds and motion. He would sit and yell until someone pressed the &quot;action button&quot; for him. The &quot;sensitive&quot; twin, however, found it much too loud and was afraid of it for the first week. He was OK if the blocks were on the moving discs, but if the blocks got to rattling around, it was too loud for him.Now, a month later, they both absolutely adore this toy! They love to knock the blocks over and bop to the music. They think it's great fun to start AND stop the action with the button - a nice touch. They both particularly liked the block that is shaped like a bee with cloth wings.The only complaint I have about this toy is that it is very loud. I don't mind the clatter of the blocks as they go chasing around, but the music itself is quite loud.I think this will continue to be a good toy for a while, too. Right now they will only knock over the blocks we've stacked, but I hope that they will also enjoy stacking the blocks themselves when they acquire those skills.I know it's a good toy when they fight over who gets to play with it - and that happens a lot with the Garden!",1
"This is your &#34;old fashioned&#34; (classic) game of &#34;Sorry&#34;... it is great. It really teaches children how to play a game patiently and how to take your lumps and setbacks.  Game is as is appears.  4 colors (4 of each), the board and the game cards are included.",1
This kit has all you need for a tie dye themed birthday party. The dyes are strong colors that last without much fading.,1
"Disclaimer: I am reviewing the product, the programmable Rover, that was offered to me for free through the Vine program.Unfortunately I never received the product! The package must have gotten lost in shipping. So I'm sorry but I cannot review the actual product, as much as we were looking forward to trying it.However, now Amazon Vine is changing their policy so I am required to write a review, even though I never received the product in question. So I'm sorry but please disregard this review...",1
"I bought this game for my 4 year old this past xmas. He loves it and it's lots of fun.The hippos do sometimes get stuck, but all you have to do is press down on the lever while also pressing down on the hippo's neck. The makes them get unstuck.Also, today I figured out where some of the lost marbles went. And how they got there I have no clue.Under the hippos necks, there are little square ridges. The absolute perfect size for guess what? Marbles! And they don't shake loose. They are a firm fit in there and hard to get out.I had to perform emergency surgery today with a pair of tweezers, but I managed to find several lost marbles. You will have to hold the lever down to extend the hippo's neck, and you will see the little square ridges and maybe a marble or two stuck in each one too.",1
"This game was bought for my 3 year old daughter. She/we have so much fun with it! It promotes turn taking, matching, sorting, problem solving and fine motor skills! If your looking for a great game that you can also use as an educational tool, this ones for you :)",1
"Great gift, Daddy and son play with it all the time together and the glow it the dark part is a plus with the days getting shorter now.",1
"I've known the game Munchkin for a very long time, and have always thought it was of the most ridiculous, yet one of the most enjoyable games to play. It's very simple, and even non-gamers can pick up the rules real quick. Play goes by very quickly, and the cards are pretty damn funny.This game is best played with a group that has an interest in fantasy, as the jokes are definitely inside jokes. However, they're likely to be the people most interested in the game to begin with.The newest edition has all the cards in color, and this is a very nice touch versus the older editions. Definitely makes it feel classier. However, unless you're putting the cards in sleeves, it's still a card game, and is still less durable than other types of board games.Overall, buy this game, call over several of your buds, and be ready to kick down the door, kill the monster, and backstab your friends, for Munchkin is as good as ever.",1
"We have used the butterfly garden twice already. I ordered the larva online (5 bucks I think) and shipping was pretty fast, within 4 or 5 days. Since my daughter was in the 5-6 range when using, it involves some adult help (transferring the cocoons, feeding, placing in a safe area away from curious cats, etc). I like that there is an option to reorder more caterpillars from their website. The two times that I ordered, I received 5 larva each time and all hatched (even when one of the cocoons fell off the paper when transporting).",1
"A smock is essential for my son (3yrs) to have for his painting. This one is well priced. My only complaint is I wish it had sleeves, even chapped ones would help. The material is very thin. Wipes up fairly well but some of the &#34;washable&#34; paints have not come off of it.",1
"On some of the pages, the items that the child is to choose are small and if the child doesn't pick &quot;just the right spot&quot; on the item it tells them they got it wrong even if its right. Very frustrating for tiny hands just learning hand coordination skills, Overall the games are pretty fun, however,I don't really feel that several of the pages are educational at all, but still fun for kids just getting started in the leapfrog system.My daughter loves the books and has gotten quite good and remembering to touch the &quot;go&quot; button when flipping pages to make the sounds go with the pages you are looking at.",1
"...from Melissa & Doug.Beyond the obvious shape, color & object learning, this toy is just plain fun! I'm a fan of wooden toys; the less toxic plastic in my world the better.My preschooler son enjoys this one a great deal & will get it out on his own, dumping it all over the floor. The puzzles are two-sided & along with the shape pieces, stored in it's own compartmented box. I wish it came with a lid, either sliding or flap, but not having a lid does make it easier for my son to see what's inside.The only downside, is the many pieces to pick up, but you can make it a fun game with your child by asking him or her to pick up first by color, then by shape, etc.There are points of course on the angular pieces, but with some supervision no one should get hurt. Hey, your child can get hurt walking...so far, no one's gotten poked, pricked or banged except when my son throws the pieces around, as he does with everything.A good puzzle set for the toddler in your life.UPDATE...almost 2 years on & the paint has held up, the wood has held up, all in all so far fairly durable. My son still plays with the puzzles & has fun!",1
"What can I say? All the kids seem to love this toy. As soon as kids come in through the door - they grab this toy first. It has been through rain, snow, heat and it's still great!",1
"Lords of Waterdeep is by far one of my favorite board games. It's a worker placement type game, that is great for 2-5 players. This game is set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, and while knowledge of the history is nice in that it would will let you recognize more of the land marks, it is not at all necessary to enjoy the game. I've played lots of worker placement games, and this remains one of my favorites as it's a solid middle ground, between rules heavy, and rules light. I highly recommend this board game.",1
"We love this! He has had it for a year now, got it at age one and it is by far one of his favorite toys.  He loves taking it off the base and rolling it on the floor.  Yet another Leapfrog product we love!",1
My son got set with his play kitchen for Christmas and was amazed at how durable the pieces are.  There are a lot of pieces in the box but has everything your little on would need.,1
"My grandkids love this (ages 5 & 7), but even the little one (18 months) watches the ""babys"" to see what they are doing.  Easy to use, doesn't take up a lot of space (you can hang it) and the kids love watching and waiting for the butterflys to emerge.  Educational, fun, teaches patience, many object lessons.  Overall a wonderful product.",1
We gave this yo our infant and he loved it. He learner to posy the cymbals at 6 months and that is for hand eye coordination. At 14 months he still loves all the pieces. The only piece I did not give him yet was the triangle,1
"Good game.  Don't be afraid of all the pieces, it's not that bad.  The rules could be a little clearer in places, but there's lots of unofficial erratta on the interweb that addresses them.  The box art is kinda weak, but it's what's on the inside that counts.",1
This is the cutest pup around. He is very durable and made of a real soft fabric. He has blue eyes with black pupils. He would be a nice companion for any one of any age.,1
"My daughter loves this game.Ok she dosen't actually love ""the game""however she does love the pins! She is an only child and while she likes this game as much as any of her other games,the pins have added hours of fun for her.They ride in her Barbie jeep,talk to one another and she also made little super hero capes for them from tissues,go figure!When I play the game with her she is satisfied but alone she prefers to walk and talk the pins all over the house.So even if this game isn't used the way it's intended thats allright by me,because she uses her imagination and keeps herself occupied.From the other reviews I would say that girls prefer this toy more than boys.By the way she is 4 yrs. old.",1
It is a thought provoking game that encourages family talk and imagination. Its also a great way to learn some new thing about your family! My husband and I enjoyed it just as much as the kids,1
"I was going to buy thisMusic & Lights Sit 'n Spin: Rockin' Tunesfor Devon for his first birthday last January, but his mother beat me to it. He's been spinning on this for eight months and still loves it. What a treat to observe that adorable little guy playing and enjoying every minute of life. His laugh is pure joy as he spins around, his smile brightening the faces of the entire family.This toy has held up well, which says much for its durability because Devon's a pretty rough-and-tumble kid ... as boys should be, of course. ... lol ...He loves the music ... much more than his mother does, so I'm going to suggest she take the advice of another reviewer and remove the batteries.  I'm certain Devon would still have fun with this classic--music or no music.Devon recommends it highly! Mommy recommends it with reservations about the too-loud music, so I'm giving it four stars.Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008author of The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley",1
We bought this for my daughter when she was about 4 months old. We were having a lot of difficulty in getting her to sleep and were desperate for anything that might work. While this didn't put her to sleep per say it did soothe her and she really enjoyed listening to the music and watching the lights and the bubbles and the fish. Now that she is 15 months old she seems to enjoy it even more! She turns it on in the morning when she wakes up and plays with it. She does go to sleep with it now and all in all it has been a terrific toy.I love the fact that she can play with it and work the controls herself. I think this is a must have!,1
"Being a parent, I would rather not give this toy any star but from a child's perspective, it is a five star rating toy. The irritating popping sounds when you child walks with it in early morning is quite disturbing yet your child will never get enough of it. It has been used by my two kids and now I have given it to my nephew who enjoys it as much as my kids did and his parents are as irritated as I was :)",1
My wife and I love this game. It's even pretty good with just two players but it's better with 3-4 players. We don't use the paper money that's included because we find it faster to just track your money and debt on your own sheet of paper. The game takes 2-2.5 hours to play because of all the addition and subtraction you have to do every turn. We keep a calculator handy because we need it pretty often.This game has much more math than Monopoly but I think it's funner.,1
"This game came highly recommended from several prominent homeschooling websites, and I have to say, my son loves it! He plays with it all the time, and it stimulates logical thinking as well. I loved playing with it myself, too ;)",1
"This game will put your noodle to work big time. Plus it is a lot of fun and challenging. You will need to use your logic and deductive reasoning to the max.The object of the game is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 colored pegs, which will remain hidden behind a shield. The codebreaker has to duplicate the exact colors and positions of the secret code. Each guess results in feedback narrowing down the possibilities of the code. The winner is the player who solves his opponent's secret code with fewer guesses.I have been playing this game for years. It still is one of my favorites. I am a game collector and got hold of ADVANCED MASTERMIND. To bad it is so hard to find. In the advanced version the color code is made of a sequence of five colors instead of four. Plus there are eight different colors to choose from, nine if you use vacant holes as a color. This raises the possible combinations from 2,000 in the classic game to around 60,000 possible combinations! Yet really advanced players should break the code in four to six guesses. You get a maximum of 12 guesses instead of the ten in the classic game. If you find this version you will love it and wonder why it's so hard to get.The only bad thing about Mastermind would be the time it takes some players to make a guess. We resolved the problem using a chess player's clock. We give anything between 6 to 12 minutes for the codebreaker, obviously stopping the clock when the codemaker places the feedback pegs. If you run out of time you get zero points.This game is for people who love to think. It is awesome for kids, and will help them develop their logic skills. Do have in mind that you will need to place the pegs in bags or they will get lost. Have fun!",1
"My kids (ages 3 and 5) love the Rudolph DVD Game.  It works in much of the same way as a regular Scene It Game but it is simplified so that even my 3 year old can get the answers right.  My kid's have watched Rudolph a few times but you don't need to know the movie to play this game (although it makes it fun to know the character's names).  We did not play with the game board because I found it too confusing for younger children.  We just played with the DVD and did not keep score.  The DVD would show a scene and then ask a question related to the scene.  An adult really needs to supervise for younger children who aren't familiar with the DVD remote control.  My kid's really enjoyed it.  The only problem I had was with the game board which was divided into 4 sections - my kid's couldn't really get the concept of it and I found it a little difficult to understand myself.  Overall, a fun game.",1
"This was our first year with an elf.  Our almost 3 year old loved it!  We had to explain a few things (and a few times), but she picked up the concept and each morning when she woke up she went looking for our elf!  She liked how he was in a different spot each morning.  I was a little worried about her touching the elf and wanting to play with him, so at first the elf was high and out of reach.  As the days went on though and we quizzed her about the elf, she knew not to touch him and would get very upset if I went anywhere near him because she didn't want the elf to lose his magic!  So, I'd say our elf is a success and a lot of fun to have around at Christmas.  Our little girl is already thinking ahead to next year when the elf comes back!",1
"I have bought this as a gift for 3 year old girls and 10 year old boys.  I don't know anybody who hasn't loved it.  The rockets shoot really high, but the stomping is easy enough for a 2 year old to do (they won't get quite the height.)  Just be sure to have enough space that you don't lose the rockets on your roof or in a neighbor's yard because they do go REALLY high when you stomp on it hard.",1
"perfect complement to play, as you add elements of realism and fixity to what is built!Good Holiday also for educators and parents with children between 5 and 12 years with a special interest in games of assembly",1
"My son was pretty excited when he saw his Rody.  It was super easy to inflate, but man.  It stunk!  It not only smelled horrible, but it had a weird oily, gritty texture.  I wiped it down with a rag, but the smell didn't fade until a few days later.  It takes a little time for the child to get used to it - mine kept getting bold and crazy and tipping forward.  But he seems to enjoy bouncing on it, and it doesn't take up a ton of room.It does NOT come with a pump, so you'll have to purchase it separate.",1
"All connections can make easier turns or even straights that need to reach just a little bit further in order to create a true ""masterpiece' of a layout. Alleviates frustrations with little ones as they want so eagerly to have their version built ""all by meself""! Wouldn't think about creating a layout without our ""wacky tracks"" now that we have discovered how great they are.",1
"If you have any power wheel and your kid(s) love it, then you know you need to keep one backup around. I certainly needed it. Nothing worse than the kids are happy playing and the car goes real slow and then dead.Amazon's price for this battery is around $10 cheaper than retail stores locally. It's a no-brainer for me.",1
"My 3 year old loves to paint with these pens!  He always asks to bring out the traditional painting supplies, but they can be a lot of work to clean up after.  I found out about these pens on a homeschool blog and decided to buy a set for him to use.  Much easier to use and clean up.  They work like markers, but the paint flows more easily without being leaky.  The larger shape of the pens fit nicely in his hands too.  Endless creative possibilities such as counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication, sequencing, patterns, and color mixing!",1
This puzzle made two little ones very happy.  The boy is two and the girl is 4 and it worked for both of them.The colors and fish are very beautiful and fun the see.  Great puzzle,1
"I think this is a wonderful game for working on coin identification and the basic principles of making change. My 5-year old daughter enjoys it. She is able to identify the coins and knows the value of each one. She is also able to count by tens and fives. However, she still needs help at times coming up with the correct change. It is a fun way to work on money skills without it being so rote.",1
"This is a nice board with a fun, colorful layout. This can be placed on the ground (my boys crawl on top of it) or it can be placed on a table. We prefer it on the ground so my little boys can reach everything. So far, (9 months of use) it is standing the wear of use. Overall, a nice purchase! I would highly recommend.",1
We're always on the lookout for a new game. Because of the reviews I decided to give this one a try. The reviews were right...this is a good game for everyone. We've played it over 10 times and still finding new ways to be strategic. We're a family of 4 with the youngest being 12. All of us learned it easily and quickly. At first we took it easy (strategic-wise) on our 12 year old but she kept beating us! This game can be simple and quick or as strategic as scrabble depending how you want to play it. If you're looking for something new-give it a try!,1
"This is such a great kitchen - it has all the bells and whistles and the stove and sink both have sounds and light up. However, it was VERY difficult to assemble (don't do it Christmas Eve) and many of the parts just do not fit properly.  We never did get the phone to install correctly.  In addition, the piece that goes inside the dishwasher and the stove is very flimsy, so much so that it is now bowed.  This stove does come with quite a few cooking pieces so that's an added plus.  It's a lot of fun for my little ""Emeril"" but find something more durable if you have a boy.",1
"I bought Thomas and Percy for my 3 year old who loves Thomas & Friends.  I also purchased a KidKraft train table which is compatible with these wooden trains.The train features magnets in the front and back to pull other trains or train cars.  The magnetic bond is strong enough for pulling multiple train cars, etc.The plastic wheels are attached to metal rods which is good because I've seen some trains with plastic rods and they don't hold up as well.My daughter takes two of these trains everywhere and they have held up to well.",1
"Bought it for my son's birthday present. He absolutely loves it. Now he can build his 'military base, camp, hideout,... whatever' on a piece of platform instead of placing them all over the floor.",1
"Great toy.  Little parts with a LOT of charge time.  Do yourself a favor.  If you have more than one kid, buy one for each...for your sanity.",1
This was a gift for a senior citizen friend of mine. It was so much fun hearing from her daily as her butterflies went through their life stages. When she let them fly in her home I went over for lunch and we had a great time tracking them.,1
bought for my granddaughter she is 11 months old and well she is walking with this thing already i just got the video she is walking and then it turns into a riding toy for when she;s got the walk going she will have a riding toy a good buy will be used a long time,1
"The original, un-messed with UNO game. Hours of fun for kids of all ages. The price is great; I bought two decks...one for home and one for camping.",1
"I love the game of Risk.  We played it incessantly as kids (although one could argue that a single game qualified since it takes 2-4 hours to play and the more you cheat the longer it takes) and I wanted to introduce my nephew to it.I wanted the version with the little army men so that the 3 and 4 year old could play with the extra little figurines while the 8 year old and I played the actual game.  That wasn't quite as successful as I'd hoped... ;)The primary con to the little action figure version:  It's much less intuitive which pieces are ""more"" armies than others... it's a bit random (the cannon was one value and the cavalry was another.  without looking at the game I couldn't tell you which was 5 and which was 10).  Since my nephew was entirely new to the game it was hard to explain why one piece was worth more than another.That said, he was plenty old enough to play the game despite the 10 and up rating on it.If you've never played Risk, it's a great game that's worth playing.  I'm sure it teaches all sorts of strategic thinking and basic math skills but really it's mostly worth it because it's FUN.  Given that the version with the little guys is ~$10 more expensive and it doesn't add anything to the game-play you could buy this version or the more basic version.",1
the handles are nice. usually tubes this cheap don't last but this one did and the kids are rough on it,1
"I think these will be useful for us but are smaller than I had expected.  I should have read the product description more closely so that's on me--they're just smaller than I was picturing.The cards themselves are about 3 1/2 by 2 3/4 inches.  The letters are 1 1/4 by 2 inches and fairly narrow--the sandpaper is only about 1/4 inch wide.  They are made out of cardstock, but it's a heavy duty cardstock and feels fairly sturdy.  They're heavier than what you'd get on a playing card or a flashcard.  The quality is reasonable for the price.At any rate, I think they are a good tactile tool for learning letters and phonics.  My son likes tracing the letters with his finger.  Today we played memory with the capital and lowercase letters.  I was also able to get a good crayon rubbing with them. Although they are smaller than I had thought they would be I think they will prove to be worth the purchase.  It's a good choice if you don't want to invest in the higher quality but more expensive Montessori style letters.",1
"I'm 47 years old & wanted to do a diarama of the battle of clontarf I have'nt did any modeling scince 1975 when I put together King Kong, Frankinstiens monster with your choice of glowing heads. Well needless to say I've been out of the loop for a while. When I recieved the figures to paint I was amazed at how small the figures were! Thank god I saw a review It was simpley titled "" A Kids Review"". In this review the kid suggested useing old dried up markers for painting smaller details. BRILLIANT I'm a artist & have a multitude of these now usefull items who say's you can't teach a old dog new tricks, thanks alot kid you rock!!!",1
"This is a cute game. My fojr year old son loves to play bunnies. His darling 9 year old sister is nice enough to entertain him once in awhile. He learns counting and colors, she learns a bit of patience and teaching skills. Very nice addition next to our small collection of board games.",1
"My son absolutely loves this toy.  It is a little smaller than I expected but that is okay as it is great as an inside playset and it reduces the risk of injury. It is lightweight so it is easy to move to clean around and yet it is very stable. The pieces all went together without any problem.  I think I had it together in less than 5 minutes without any need for help.  The only negative was that the platform was missing, but I called the manufacturer and after a very short conversation with a customer service representative, I received the platform in just 48 hours.  Although the age recommendation is listed as 18 months to 4 years, I was pleased to see the 5 year old girl I babysit spend 2 hours playing in and on it the day after it arrived.",1
"I have had the Kettler trike for about 8 years.. I got it, with the attached 2nd person part for my first 2 kids... its about to be handed down to the 4th kid and looks just as good as the day we got it.  The one thing I had to replace was the seatbelt for one of the seats... not because the product failed but because my stupid dog chewed it off.  So, the product is fantastic.  Easy to use...the strap is so easy to install. Totally worth the investment seeing as how four kids will use it and then someone else will enjoy it and it will be fine for as long as its not treated poorly. That is how products should be made... made to last, to be passed down.  I appreciate a good product and this is it!",1
These were a hit with my grandbaby and even though she has gotten older she still likes to pop them apart and wear them as a necklace although they are not pliable.,1
This is a really neat toy. My niece and nephew received one of these several years ago when my kids were too young to fully enjoy.  However I remembered this and now that they are 6 and 8 it is a perfect toy for them. They love having it start out small and grow into a huge ball.  I needed to return the first one we got due to one of the brackets falling off during shipping but I returned that one and very quickly got a new one back and the kids are thoroughly enjoying it. They love getting inside of it too!,1
"My daughter received this gift last year at 7 months. She wasen't able to use the mallot that comes with it or push the balls down very well, but loved the music that plays whenever you get the ball through or push the nose. We lost some of the balls and called the company, who then sent us four additionals at their own expense.",1
great outdoor activity my daycare kids and my own kids love it,1
"I bought the Stomp Rocket Jr. Glow Kit as a fun gift for my three year old son. The Amazon reviews were over the top positive and the price tag was low--so I thought why not? This item has far exceeded my expectations. This is my favorite toy ever, and my son is in complete agreement.The idea is that you stomp on the stomp box to send one of four foam rockets flying through the air. It is so easy, addictive, and fun. The stomp box is soft so even my three year old can send rockets hurtling 50 feet or more into the air. The air rushes through a flexible tube that you put the foam rocket on and sends it way higher than you think you're going to send it. The whole set up is connected to a plastic stand of three pieces that you snap together. Only a single wing nut attachment (included)is needed to hold it all together.You can angle the tube to send the rocket straight up, horizontally, or on a variety of trajectories. The foam rockets are very durable. They are soft so I wouldn't let a dog or cat chew them, but they have been indestructible in my son's overeager hands and have lasted damage-free through thousands of launches.My son is still working on coordination and has tripped over the stand on multiple occasions so it does come apart rather easily, but it just snaps back together--no big deal. I'd like to see an improvement in future versions, but I don't see a reason to downgrade the rating for this small inconvenience.We played with it for around an hour and a half the first time that we used it. If you have a child this young, then you know the miracle of keeping a child entertained that long. It is an outdoor toy for sure, but I'm thinking we'll get use out of it in a hallway or children's playroom during stormy days. I hope you'll order one if you are on the fence about it. The whole family will love it.",1
"My preschool age daughter loves board games, but I can only take so much of Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, or Hi Ho Cherry-O.  Max is so much better than the ""regular"" board games you find at stores like Target.  The objective of this game is to get the squirrel, mouse, and bird to safety before the cat Max gets to them.  You roll the dice to determine if Max moves or the little creatures move. When Max gets too close, you can call him back to the starting point for a treat. Kids and adults can work together to try to get the little creatures to safety. My preschool age daughter has no trouble figuring out the rules and she enjoys calling Max back for a treat.  Like I mentioned before, some preschool games get old real quick for adults, but Max is entertaining for all ages. The only complaint that I have is that the pieces are made of cardboard paper. I think it would be more appealing and durable if they have little plastic figures for the animals.",1
"I discovered this game about twenty years ago. My friends and I immediately got hooked. I still have the cards we used then. This game was so hot it outsold Monopoly for a while.The object of the game is to accumulate 5,000 points in several hands of play. You do this by traveling a distance of 700 or 1,000 miles (depending on the number of players) before your opponents do. But you have to do this while your opponents throw hazards at you such as accidents, flat tire, speed limits, etc. You will of course do the same to them. So the game becomes a race against time as all teams struggle to repair their cars while trying to stop their opponents and still manage to complete the race before the cards run out.The game also included safety cards and bonuses depending on how you play your cards. This ups the strategy elements. But the best part of this game is that it's FUN to play. Especially when, for example, your opponents are out of gas and you have most of the gas cards on your hand; and you show them your cards just to see the pain on their faces... sweet.For young ones it is educational since you have to use math and matching skills.This Collector's Edition version is nice. It has the original art work of the 1962 game. Plus it has a car shaped tray which is OK. It might be a bit pricey but it is totally worth it. If you like card games you will love Mille Bornes. Have fun and drive safely (if you do you get a 300 point bonus).",1
Fun game something different we own tons of board games...Deluxe Pit...is a great edition to our closet full of family fun games...I recommend this game!~,1
"I bought this game for my 4-year-old grandson. It is not challenging enough for him, although we happily played it and had a fun time. However, he was much more taken with Junior Monopoly (which requires an adult to do the reading until he memorizes the cards). The Sequence game is really just another version of a Bingo/Tic Tac Toe-type game and he has at least one other game like that. For kids that are into games, though, I would say this is a decent choice. The learning is simply in figuring out a winning strategy; there is no content learning as the animals on the playing cards are ones that probably most 3-year-olds already know. One advantage of this game is that it is short, so if you have a small window of time to play a game, it's a good choice (versus Monopoly, which is great for a long rainy afternoon).",1
"My 3 year old loves this.  By far the best $20 we have spent.  The stomp rocket has provided several hours, (sometimes most of the afternoon) of joy already.  I am not sure if he has more fun stomping the rocket and seeing the rocket fly - or chasing them down or trying to catch them.The toy is a good learning tool also teaching trajectory, pressure, etc.The only complaint is the plastic tripod that holds the rocket often breaks apart and you have to put it back together for your little ones.  Which takes about 30 seconds about every 10 rocket blasts.",1
"Fun game with easy-to-follow rules. Dozens of variants if you don't like the genre. Quick games, too. It is a clear hit and a great gift for those who like games like Settlers of Catan.",1
"This is such a well-reviewed game, I do not think I have much to add other than my 12 year old son, a huge RPG fan, LOVES it and enjoys playing it on his own.By chance, I happened into his bedroom to look at the game and noticed it came with character layout sheets.  I was thankful I was able to snag a clean copy of the sheet for the manufacturer-authorized photocopying before he had used them all to develop his characters (I think there are only 5 sheets in the box.) I now have one set aside in my office for the future.",1
Eight year old daughter likes this game.  It's a great game to learn how things balance.  It's fun.  And was a good price.,1
This book looks really fun and cool. Haven't opened or used it yet because I got it for my 6 year old daughter for xmas but i know she will enjoy doing the projects with me.  she is very creative and loves crazy weird stuff so this seems right up her alley.,1
"Sit N' Spin is still a great toy!  Durable, easy to clean, and fun for a wide range of ages.  My daughter got this as a gift at age 4 or 5, and she still plays with it at age 6.  Yes, the ""rockin' tunes"" are annoying for parents (my husband HATES the music), but we solved this by making Sit N' Spin ""basement or outside only"" toy.  Ours has even survived getting wet on the light panel.EDIT 2009: Five years later, and we still have the Sit N' Spin.  Now our 3yo son plays with it.  This toy really will hold up, maybe I'll even keep it for the grandchildren I'll probably have one day!",1
I've stocked up on these ThinkFun games.  They're great for cottages and family trips.  The best part is you don't need batteries!,1
"Arkham Horror is one of my favorite board games of all time. Unlike the vast majority of games ever devised, the players are placed into a cooperative - not a competitive - environment, and with good reason: the horrors of H. P. Lovecraft's imagination have sprung to life and the eve of the Apocalypse has come! This rich setting, coupled with the quality and intricate detail of Fantasy Flight's design, provides countless hours of enjoyment for fans of tabletop strategy games and mythical worlds. Also, numerousexpansionsets exist to inject new life into the base game, like adding additional neighborhoods to a Monopoly board.Each turn requires a good deal of maintenance and upkeep, as if you are in a role-playing game where everyone shares dungeon master duties, or playing a video game where the computer's calculations must be done by hand. This level of complexity, as well as the subject matter, make it unsuitable for young children; any teenager or adult comfortable with Magic: The Gathering or Axis & Allies will likely master the mechanics in two or three sittings.As others have noted, the rules are at times almost incomprehensible; I sometimes wonder whether any two playgroups have ever played by the same interpretation of the rules, let alone the correct one! It is completely understandable that some people dislike the game because of this fact, but for those of us who recognize that the point of the game (from the monster's perspective) is to drive the players insane, that is to be expected!",1
"The tub is smaller than I expected but that's because I didn't read the dimensions before I ordered it!  However, it's full of fun stuff and lots of supplies!  Our 5  year old can't wait to get everything out of it and start creating!",1
"I rate toys using a 3 category system. I look at their entertainment value, durability, and creativity. Every toy needs to keep a child's attention, be able to stand up to their rough playing, and either promote their creativity or be used to play in creative ways. I'll start with a short review and then explain my reasons for the rating in detail.We bought this for my 3-year-old daughter for Christmas, and it has been a big hit.  Her and her 2-year-old brother beg to play it everyday when I get home from work.  It is fun and colorful, and helps to teach them how to be patient and take turns as well as how to have fun, even if you don't finish first.ENTERTAINMENT:Candy land is simple enough for a 2-year old to figure out, and fun enough not to make the parents who have to play with them completely miserable.  It brings back memories from my childhood, so I have a lot of fun playing as well.My daughter loves counting the colors, and she loves narrating her path and telling stories about how she met Queen Frostine on her way to King Candy's castle.  My son loves drawing the cards and moving his piece along the path.DURABILTY:The board is very sturdy, but the cards get pretty messed up pretty quick.  My son has already crumpled up the cupcake card, so we know when that one is coming in the stack. There is a version of this game that has a spinner instead of cards, which they got from my brother for Christmas (what a coincidence), but my kids enjoy picking a card more than using the spinner.CREATIVITY:My daughter gets pretty creative telling stories about the Candy Land characters, but the best part about this game is that it teaches kids how to be patient and wait for their turn in a creative way.My kids are pretty patient for being toddlers, but they are still toddlers.  When they want something, they want it, and they usually aren't willing to wait for their turn.  But within a few minutes of playing, they were remarkably good at taking turns.  They cheered each other on, even if the other one just passed them up.  They loved every minute of it.Outside of game play, I have noticed them taking turns with toys and not fighting as much.  They still fight, just not as much. They share their toys a lot better.  I didn't expect that to happen. I don't think people really think that a board game would be able to teach kids life lessons, but its surprising how they carry the little things into their everyday interactions.In conclusion, this is a great way to introduce children to board games and teach them patience and good sportsmanship.  Its a must have for young children.",1
I noticed the numbers on all the engines so I bought this one so I could make it so my son could count the engines from1-10.  This is number 4.  Only the coal cars are marked.  This is a large engine.  It's size makes it difficult to push around and it derails easily.  My son is 16 moths old and has trouble with this engine I recommend it if for the 2+ crowd.,1
"I loved this , my granddaughter loved this and her mother used one when she was young too, great product",1
So glad I could find this on line. My grandson loves science and I could not find anything in the stores. He has enjoyed his Science Wiz.,1
This will be used by our granddaughter who is 6 years old.  She will be able to make usable pot holders for her parents.  It has not been too hard for her.,1
"The art is nice in this coloring book. But I find some of the pages to be boring and repetitive. Thin pages mean you cannot use markers, which is a bummer.",1
"My daughter received this pogo stick as a gift when she was five.  At age six, she is still getting the hang of it, but she and her friends in the neighborhood have had a lot of fun with it.  The foam cover is durable and prevents rust and dents which could render the toy unsafe.  Also, the spring is covered, so there is no easy opportunity for injury to the child or damage to the spring.  This is quieter and safer than the pogo stick I grew up with in the 80's!",1
Great stickers but not quite what I was expected probably my fault for not reading more carefully I though this was an actual book,1
"We bought this toy for our son while out grocery shopping. He showed a lot of interest in it at the store, however he he didn't start to play with it at all until he had it for 3 months. Now he runs through the house squealing and laughing. There isn't really any educational value to this toy, but I guess it could teach him something he already knows....... cause and effect!",1
"My wife and I, along with our 5.5 year old enjoy this game as a step up from crazy eights and go fish or old maid.  This game requires more brain activity, but teaches a lot of skills that are good to have.  The cards are of nice quality, and the box that it comes in is nice and sturdy to keep them safe.  Don't hesitate to get this if you have younger kids.",1

"My husband and I were so excited to give our 18 month old a sit n spin for Christmas.  Growing up, we had both loved sit n spin!  But, when we put the toy together we were somewhat dissapointed.Is it just us, or did this toy get much smaller?  Both of us thought the sit n spin shrunk.  Also, it seemed much flimsier than I remember my blue sitnspin that I had back in the 80's.  I remember using this toy as a much older child making me think it was bigger back then.Overall this is still a great toy!!  Our toddler is just getting the hang of it, but I know he'll be spinning on it for hours someday.  I think the music is cute, and the batteries can always be removed if you don't like it.The big dissapointment is the small size  and flimsyness of the item!  Our son barely fits on it. I think it cold get alot more use by kids (and adults!!!) if it was larger.",1
I just finished this puzzle the other day.  It is such a great picture.  I was going to seal it and have it framed and hang it but I know I will enjoy doing it again in the future.  The pieces are sturdy and the puzzle is so colorful.,1
I purchased this for my husband as a gift. He loves it and &#34;plays&#34; with it frequently. Works well and would definitely recommend it to anyone.,1
"My daughter loves this toy. She is now 4 years old. I would not recommend it for small children because the lights are small. Sometimes they are hard for my daughter to handle. It comes with many different templates to make all sorts of things, all you have to do is punch the lights through the black template. However, this toy is different than the ones we remember because the lights do not stay in well if used without the templates (making your own design). Also if you use it this way, it is not as easily seen since the background is white.",1
"After ripping through 2 strollers I decided to get this cart to replace the stroller. My daughter loves it, which means I love it too.",1
"My son is 3 and he loves to help me vacuum. He used to have the Little Tikes vacuum and outgrew it. For Christmas I went online and searched for an ""upgrade"" for him that was a little more like a real vacuum. This one is great! It has a detachable dirt devil handheld unit that really sucks up dirt! It snaps back into the main unit and the vacuum noise sounds real! He really thinks he's vacuuming with me, it's so cute! A great buy! However, the downside is it doesn't seem as durable as it could be for the price. He has yet to break it but for kids that are hard on toys and drop them often, this one might need a little care.",1
"This game really is wonderful. Those of you who love Scrabble will take to this like nobody's business. It can feel a bit like you're watching a chess tournament though if you aren't setting time limits on player's turns. I've seen plays take up to 20 minutes in the past. Rushing them actually improves the feel of the game though. Either way, a fun game that you should own.",1
Okay these are just completely awesome! I got them for my nephew and I have so much fun playing with them all the time with him!,1
"I got this for my youngest son when he was 8 months old.  Now he's 18 months old and he still plays with this all the time!  At first he was just interested in chewing on the ""mail"" and spinning the bumblebee, but now he pretends to mail the letters.  His 3 year old brother loves being a ""mailman"" also!  I never would have bought it if I hadn't found it on sale because I never thought they would have enjoyed it so much! I'm so glad that I bought it.I definitely wish that the bumblebee had an on/off switch.  That buzzing gets really irritating.  If it gets to a point where I can't stand it, I can just take the batteries out.  It would just be nice to have the option to turn it off.",1
"The best games are usually the most simple.  This game is simple, but that doesn't mean it's not challenging or fun.It's a good child/adult game, and I'd highly recommend this over some of the ""gimmikicy"" games out there.  It can be played over and over with a lot of different variations on the outcome, and while a good player can win consistantly, like many decent games that don't rely on chance, this game can be played to ties or near ties if both people understand it.  I think that makes it a better game.It's good for strengthening logical thinking.",1
"My 17 month old son was scared to death of this tunnel. So is one of the dogs. My wife and I like it. Our boy likes to throw his toy balls into it for me to fetch. The dogs don't understand that the screen-fabric ""windows"" are in fact not escape portals. It took time for son to come to love it. But for a while, it sat stored very compactly and unobtrusively.Collapsed / compressed / stowed into the shape of a small hula-hoop, I had the dogs jump through it like trained circus animals. To our son, that looked like fun, so he ""jumped"" (awkwardly stepped) through a few times.Then we un-did two of the three velcro straps that are used to bind it into a flat shape, and the tunnel partially opened into a half-round, like a macaroni noodle. A dog walked in, and our son was satisfied he could see both ends of the dog depending on what opening he looked through. So he went a few times.Then we opened it up fully, and after mom crawled through he took a few minutes and warmed up to it. What a great way to wear out the little guy before getting ready for bed in the evening. Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over he crawled through.It turns out the tunnel is quite the interactive parent-toddler play device. Throw a ball in. Stick your face upside down on one end. ""Twist"" the other end upward so your kid has to pop up as if in a rabbit hole. My wife and I are both constantly amazed how many miles this tunnel logs, but, come to think of it, I remember vividly logging similar miles in my tunnel as a pre-schooler and kindergartener, even without the parent involvement.And, again, the best feature is that is quickly compresses down to nothing and stores out of the way when play time is over.",1
Our Goodnight Goodnight Construction site obsessed toddler loves this little guy. It's a good size for a 2 year to cart around. The main body is soft and the boom and tracks are a nylonish material. It seems sturdy.,1
My daughter got this set two years ago for Christmas and she still loves it. You really can serve warm tea in the cups. It's a keeper!,1
It was bright and he enjoyed watching the lights move and the music is excellent with very rich tones.  We had this in his crib and he loved it.  He now at 16 mos has found a new use for this toy.  He puts it on the floor and since we have it set to the motion feature he runs all around it making it go off all day long.,1
"Birthday gift for my seven year old granddaughter.  Looks fine, and she loves the game!  She had never heard of it, which made it an even better surprise.",1
My Grand Daughter loves anything Owl and she will love these stickers! I liked the price and its worth the money.,1
So much fun.....love to play!  A lot of fun for kids and fir their families.It is awesome to play this game with my grand child.,1
I'm hooked on raising butterflies. My grandchildren have all raised and released Painted Lady and Monarch Butterflies. That is one thing I am proud to have introduced them to.,1
"We use these in our home classroom & they're great for so many things.I use them mainly for block pattern puzzles but, they're a great manipulative for many other jobs as well.",1
"Got this for six year old boy, he LOVES it.  The elfs name is Bluki (we figured that out as a family, was a bit complicated but fun).  It's a bit of a chore moving him every night, just because sometimes we forget and have to scramble in the AM or come up with a reason why Bluki is in the same place (he liked that spot, I guess).  At 30 bucks it seems pretty expensive, but at least it's going to be used for a couple more years and probably passed on to someone else by that time since it will stay in good shape.  We place Bluki up high in different places around the house so our son can't get to him.  He knows he's not supposed to touch him so he doesn't even ask or try.  Bluki is now back in his box waiting till next year...I mean, he's back at the North Pole with Santa.  There isn't much to the elf, but he's very light and flexible which makes him easy to place in odd spots.  It's all just very cute and Christmasy and the little ones love it so I highly recommend.",1
"Great piece to take along for rides or trips - nice and big enough for a 7-year-old to work with, and great size to take along in the car!",1
"I highly recommend this for pre-readers who recognize the letters of the alphabet.  This game reinforces letter recognition and gives kids confidence and insight into reading.  Best of all, it can be played with 1 player!  My 4 year-old loves to play games and gets frustrated when I can't play with her, but this is one she plays by herself!  Very stimulating and educational for 3s and 4s, but they will probably grow out of it once they can read.  My daughter didn't seem to care that she couldn't read before playing this game, but in the past 2 days since I opened the game, she has really shown an interest in learning to read.  Desire to read is very important for pre-readers, and this is the only thing I've found to encourage that besides the most important activity of all - reading to her.",1
"Educational way to learn maths, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. You can introduce the kids to fractions as well. Family time with kids and post dinnertime gaming are also great side benefits.  Instead if watching the non educational and often non useful TV programs, the game encourages to have a group time playing. Kids will surely enjoy the games and learn success/failure/problem solving/strategy formations. I am a big believer in role playing board games and abstract board games. Highly recommend this game!",1
"We got this when my daughter wasn't quite old enough for it yet and it sat in a corner for a few months.  Now that she is 13 months old and likes ride on toys, this is one of the best.  Plus, it looks nice and old fashioned so no one thinks that it looks out of place when it is left out (as everything always seems to be).",1
"Having never played Arkham Horror or Mansions of Madness, I will review this game based solely on its own merit, not a comparison as most people have done.  That being said, I have seen AH and MoM played at conventions, and they seem really complex with lots of things to keep track of.  This game, however, is pretty simple, perhaps too simple for some.  This really is just Yatzee Chthulhu, thats a pretty good name for it.  Luckily, I love Yatzee and I love H.P. Lovecraft, so this was an instant success in my house.  What I really like about this game is that adults and kids can play it together and can both have fun for different reasons.  The adults can pretend to be hunting monsters, while the kids can enjoy finally being able to play one of ""Daddy's Games"" without having to have their hand held the entire time.Another thing I like about, is the rules can be tweeked.  Having too much trouble, hand out some extra clues or spell cards.  Too easy, add some extra doom tokens.  There really is no reason to bash this game on the rules when you can easily change them and make the game better.  My only gripe is the lack of diversity of your items.  You get Spells, Unique Items, Common Items, and Allies, but they all basically allow you to do the same things.  So, my question is, why bother with all the different kind of cards, why not just have an items pile, with all those mixed in, like Last Night on Earth?Bottom line, enjoyable, but slightly flawed.",1
"Whats great about Elder Signs is it is easy for people who aren't hardcore gamers to get into it. It is a great gateway into the Arkham universe. I am a total board game geek and most of my friends and family aren't. I haven't had a hard time getting anyone into this game, and most can't wait to play it again!!",1
"I bought this for our 15 month old for Christmas and it's been a family favorite.  Young guest enjoy it as well.  Sturdy, and friendly looking.",1
"Present for my 7 year old son.  Really fun and simple game.  I believe it teaches kids to pay attention to detail.  I found my 15 year old daughter and her 17 year old boyfriend playing it and they enjoyed it.  There's only one set up and that's putting the faces in the frames when you first get the game.  Now when my son wants to play, we get it out of the box and start playing.  Each game goes really fast, too.",1
"My daughter is almost 4 and she loves this little vacuum. She like to ""help out"" and now she feels like she can.Pros:1. Actually picks up a bit of dust2. Lights up3. Realistic sound4. Durable so far5. Just the right size6. Fairly easy to operate (I think a just-turned-3-year-old might have trouble with it but by almsot 4 they can learn with a little practice.)Cons:1. It would be nice for the little dust trap to have a hinged opening so it's easier to get the lint out. (My daughter loves getting to empty it but since the opening is just a little hole about the size of a nickel it's difficult.)2. My daughter was dissapointed that the hose that stretches over the back doesn't come off so that she can vacuum the tops of things like mommy. It really bothered her at first.)These are the only reasons that I didn't give it a 5 star rating.Overall we are very pleased with this little vacuum.",1
This gator inflatable is great!  I like the handles and the fact that it's large enough for an adult to ride on.  I always wanted one of these as a kid.  It was great to finally get one.,1
Like the X-wing this comes with pilots/upgrade cards not in the core game. Amazons reduced pricing makes it cheaper to buy these rather than core games in multiples. The detail like all figures in this game is outstanding.,1
"I read that these were made in the USA so no worry about lead paint issues from China.  They are lovely, well crafted and have a nice bag for storage.  Thanks for a good product and good service.",1
We bought this as a birthday present for our 1yo daughter. She had always loved the big one at her pediatrician's office and I wanted to get her one that was smaller so she could set it on her lap or have on a table in front of her. This was perfect for learning. She plays with it more and more as she gets older and understands the concept of the various routes.  I think it's a great gift idea for a young toddler learning motor skills with their hands and visuals.,1
"I just received this today so my Granddaughter hasn't seen it yet. I do not like that the bread doesn't stick  to the pickles or tomatoes very well. I guess because of the shape. They do really look real.The top of the tuna looks cute but it also looks dangerous. It looks like it will break off with a few pulls. Cute idea but this is why they say for three year olds. I will need to put this up for a year.I usually buy Mellisa and Doug stuff but her other grandmother had gotten it for her, so I thought I would try this brand. I will get back in a few month's and let you know how they match up.",1
"This is a great casual game.  Simple rules, and way fun.  I would recommend this game.  Very similar to Rummicube.",1
"I found this to be a quiet, simple game. I have nothing bad to say about it, but it is the type of game that if you like a stealing & trumping card game... this is for you. The morbid theme gives it a spooky twist. I didn't find it a great party/ social game though. For that I would recommend ""No Thanks"".",1
"With two kids we go to a lot of birthday parties and many times I don't know the kids personally.  I have one in preschool and one in grade school and this is my go to gift for girls and boys in both age groups.  I usually purchase 3-4 of these at a time and keep them on hand for gifts.  So far everyone has loved them. They don't last forever, so even kids who have had them before love getting a new one.  Since this version glows in the dark,  I like it for summer birthdays when the kids are outside later.",1
"My wife and I continuously return to Bananagrams for its originality and speed. Players are given several letters and make words out of the all the given existing letters upon which the player says, ""Peel."" Every player receives several new letter tiles until they are likewise used up in words and the player says, ""Peel."" The process continues until all the tiles from the draw pile are gone, when the first player to use all the letters says, ""Bananagrams"" instead of ""Peel."" Game over.The game requires quick problem solving, a wide vocabulary, the ability to adapt, and the ability to start over if you can't fit in the newly acquired tiles. It's lots of fun amongst two people or a large group of friends; it doesn't become boring; and it is fast if you have a hankering for a quick word game! Any family or guest-entertainer needs it!",1
My cousins would always bring this game over for the holidays. At first I thought it was just for old people. Then I played it...It's a lot of fun! You have the traditional four suits or crowns and add the star. You start with three cards and three is wild. You make a suit run or pairs. Each round you add a card and that number in the hand is wild. The first I've to go out gets zero pounds and then the rat have to go out as best they can. Add up the leftovers for points. Whoever has the lowest score wins!We all really enjoy this game. It's a family tradition now.The only complaint is that towards the end you get a massive hand if cards but it's just a minor complaint. Also there us a lot of shuffling.,1
"I bought this card game mostly because of the great reviews it received from other customers.  I was not disappointed.  My 10 year old son and I have tons of fun playing this game, along with Five Crowns, which we bought previously.  If you like word games like Boggle, I would highly recommend this card game.",1
"After playing Gloom, I thought to myself, you know what I need, this game. Then I heard that there was a Cthulhu skin of the game, and I changed my statement to say, &#34;I need THAT game!&#34;In Cthulhu Gloom, just as in Gloom, players have a family. Their goal is to kill off their family while they are in the worst possible condition. They do this by playing negative pathos cards on them.Players draw 5 cards. Players play two cards on their turn. Players can only play unfortunate death (not including action cards, or card effects) on a family member during their first play of their turn.Players can play any card on any family member, including other player's family members. Cards have effects that are instant (effects the person who played the card), constant (effects the person who the card was played on, as long as it is visible), of continuous (like constant, but as long as the continuous logo is visible, it is in effect).Once a players entire family is dead, the game is over and all player's add up their families pathos score. The player with the lowest pathos score is the winner.WHAT DID I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME:When we play the game, and while I can't force you to do it, we tell stories about how it happened. As if we were all old spinsters telling gossip about our friends / extended family.It's also fun to try to cancel, or take death away from a character. The more you get into the game, the more you can take out of it.The theme of the elder gods really adds to the Gloom effect, I dare say even better then the original game.WHAT DID I DISLIKE ABOUT THE GAME:To be honest, the only thing I dislike is a necessary evil for balancing, so I will not sully the game by insulting their mechanics.WHO IS THIS GAME DESIGNED FOR?Have you played Gloom? Do you like Elder Gods? Then this game is for you.RATING!6.8 out of 8. It's fun, but at times it can slow down if people lose their steam. If you can keep it up this game wont let you down.",1
"We have only opened one pack so far. It has a great quality, not sticking, easy to play with. Just make sure after using it, put it in a sealed bag/container and then you can re use it many times.I wish the sealed containers would come with it. I am using a small ziploc to store it.",1
"I have always loved this game - from the time I was a kid to now - I love how you make a little machine that captures the mouse at the end.  Careful, you may turn your kid into a future engineer!",1
Given to granddaughter as a gift - she was happy with them - she was using them on Christmas day and her drawings were pretty neat.,1
"I remember playing this game with my best friend when we were little, so of course I had to buy it for my son!!  This game is great for little ones because it teaches them how to pay attention, look for detail, and search for clues. It's not even a hard game once you play it a time or two, and that's always great so that you don't always have to sit and read the directions every time you play the game.  The only drawback to this game, is that you have to keep up with all of the pieces - we lost one of the people pieces, and so we had to sort through the other color to find that same person to take them out of the game.  It would be nice to have a back up set of people pieces or something, but we know how to improvise, thank goodness :)",1
Purchased this as a gift for my brother and he loves it. I've had (and still have) several SYMA helicopters and they're all pretty great and lots of fun.,1
"This game works great with kids, although I'll admit I've had plenty of fun playing with my own age group. It's all luck with the only strategy coming from which piece you want to move. But I've still had plenty of fun, although it can get frustrating not being able to roll a 6 (which you can try and fix with house rules). My suggestion is to make sure you have all the pieces kept in a plastic bag because they are very easy to lose, especially if kids are playing. I haven't had any trouble with the bubble (excuse the pun), and it works just fine. You always have the option of using a different die, but the best part of the game is popping that bubble! The best feeling is when you get sweet revenge by bumping back a player to start. I would get the game it's heaps of fun!",1
happy with the product great addition to the collection'service excellent would order again from this vendorhappy in generalgood,1
"We (our daughters and I) have had a number of different potholder looms over the years, and this Harrisville Designs Potholder Loom has to be the best of all of them. This well-made metal loom has a nice weight to it, and the pegs/prongs are curved outward to help keep the loops from popping off while weaving.This high-quality potholder loom set comes enough cotton loops to make 2 potholders, 1 metal potholder loom (mine was dark green), an illustrated instruction sheet, 1 metal weaving (double ended) hook, and 1 plastic crochet hook for finishing off the potholders. The cotton loops are bright, colorful and well-made, tons better than cheaper nylon loops and well-worth the extra cost when it comes time to buy refills.Potholder looms are a timeless craft, and a great way to introduce young ones to weaving -(our daughters started using potholder looms around 8 or 9 years old), and I still cherish the potholders they've made me throughout the years. This is not just for kids, I love making potholders as well; it's relaxing and a fairly short process with such nice finished results. Also, if you like giving home-baked gifts to others, adding a customized-to-their-kitchen-colors potholder to the baked item makes the gift extra-special.This would make a wonderful gift for yourself, or most any crafter, youngish or older. Because this can be kind of addictive, you may want to purchase an extra set of refill (cotton) loops to go along with it. It is worth noting that Harrisville Designs also offers single-color refill bags of cotton loops, for example:Harrisville Designs Cotton Loops, Blackwhich makes customizing your potholders' colors very easy.",1
"I purchased this product for my 18 month old son at Christmas.  I can tell that he is just on the developmental cusp of understanding this toy and that while he is interested in it now, he will get more out of it in the future.  It is a quality product and would be durable for even a preschool, I think.  It is smaller than I imagined, and thus I would not give it to a child younger than one because the pieces would be tempting to teeth on, but at least four of the pieces are small.This is not my favorite toy to play with my son because it is not very exciting. I like it, but I wish I would have purchased a different geometric stacker, perhaps one that has the three different shaped towers.  I think that might have been a little more fun.",1
"I looked online to purchase a new game to play, as Scrabble was running its course, and came across Carcassonne. Although the game carries stellar reviews, I was skeptical about how entertaining and involved the game would be. It only took one round to dispel my reservations about Carcassonne, and it has become a nightly fixture. The game is fun with 2 people, and maintains the same levels of enjoyment and strategy with additional players.The game is played with durable, well made tiles, and in a small box which has smart storage for all of the pieces. Carcassonne does not take much time to set up and break-down after rounds, and can be completed start to finish in under an hour.Although the rules are very simple, the game is complex, as the great number of various tiles allows for iteration upon iteration of potential outcomes, which cause for very strategic rounds. Although there is some luck involved, strategy prevails, unlike Risk which is decided by lucky dice rolling.I cannot speak to whether the game is appealing to children, but think it is certainly worth checking for people in the market for new games to add to their collection.",1
Keep the paint off of my daughters clothes and super easy to wash off when she is finished. Worth ever penny.,1
I bought this for my six year old daughter for Christmas. I have been playing the game of life for years and can't wait to share it with her. Lots of lessons to be learned from this family game!,1
"I'd say no board gaming/zombie movie enthusiast's collection is complete without this andZombies. Although they share a theme, they each have their own flavor of zombie movie. I'd say LNoE feels more like an 80s tongue in cheek zombie movie with the teens and purposely cheesy heroes, while Zombies!! feels more like the classic, overwhelming number of walking dead in Romero films. This one is easily the more complex and deeper of the two, so if you had to get one, I'd say go with this one, but zombies gets credit for creating the claustrophobic feeling of being surrounded and feeling hopeless. I've played this one a few times now, and while the basic rules are great to get you started, it gets even more fun with the advanced rules, and they're not that much more complicated. I'd say you're ready for them after a couple of basic level games. There are a good number of scenarios to choose from and with one side playing zombie and the other heroes, there's definitely a lot of replay value. The pieces are great quality for a board game and the cards are well done too, and can sometimes even being pretty funny as in being stuck in a location with a hero of the opposite sex while you share a ""let's at least have tonight"" moment. The accompanying CD gets a bad rap from reviewers but I thought it added to the feel, and hey how many games give you a free CD of music to set the mood? (Also found adding some dark classical or 80s goth does a good job of this) The rules can feel a little clunky at times, but it works very well. It feels balanced despite players going by different mechanics. An incredibly fun game that will leave every player feeling as satisfied as getting some fresh BRAAAAAINS! nomnomnom",1
"This game was an interesting addition to our board game collection (which numbers over 150 games and expansions).  I had originally looked at buying this game for a friend for his birthday but my wife and I decided to keep it based on Tom Vassel's review on Dice Tower.Overall it is a good game with a very interesting, multi-path, scoring system.  Unfortunately there is only really 1 path to winning and once my gaming group figured it out we all do the same thing, which takes away from the replay ability.  After a few weeks it ended up on the shelf and I look forward to trying it out again in a few months.I gave it a 4 star rating because it really is a well put together game, the lack of a replay value might have given it a 3 star but I honestly don't want to discourage anyone from buying this product.As always, the best price was here on Amazon and my local game shop didn't have any.",1
"My daughter is 19 months and drags this doll around all the time. It's very well made, very cute and looks very similar to Abby on tv. We also bought Grover, Cookie Monster, Elmo, Bert and Ernie. They are all worth the price on Amazon. We hear our daughter say 'Abby' all day and she hugs the toy a lot! Gund is the way to go for Sesame Street dolls.",1
I bought this when my daughter was 16months and she loves it cause she has the foood sets to go with it. Shes acts like she is shopping and even putts her baby dolls in the front seat. The only thing that is if they try to put to much heavy stuff in the cart it will sometimes fall forward.Its very light wieght and duriable,1
"You can't go wrong with Percy.  This basic Percy is great, and if you have not bought a set that includes Percy, Amazon's price cannot be beat.However, if you are at all considering buying a set, make sure and check if there is one with Percy available. We now have multiple Percy trains that have come with sets.  While Thomas comes with just about every set, Percy is also included in several.",1
"Grandkids are 2-1/2 and 3-1/2, and the toy store recommended these as something both kids could enjoy, and they were right.  I just used plain white paper but might get one of the &#34;coloring books&#34; for next visit.  I always supervise their activities, so we had no incidents with hair, face, carpet, clothing, etc.  I'm sure glad I found these, especially with summer coming and it's too hot to be outside much.",1
The rules are always changing but you catch on fast. When I first played this game I was confused as ever but now I am a master after a few rounds. Highly recommend you get this and combine it with several of the other versions.,1
My niece loves this so much we bought another one for our little cousin too. I am not sure how long they will like it since it doesn't do anything new after the first few times but it is fun to kill time.,1
"I bought this to use as a ball pit for my 2 year old.  She loves it!  So does my 7 year old!  Several reviewers said they used 600 pit balls to fill the pool.  That is a good amount.  I first ordered 300 balls.  And I had 100 already from and old set.  With 400 balls you can still see the bottom of the pool.  So I ordered 200 more and that filled the pool enough so you could not see the bottom.  However, 200 more balls would be nice but money in my wallet is nice too.Now my pro's and con's section -Cons:There is no padding on the bottom.  If you use this as a pool then I would recommend to use it only on grass or over one of those rubber play mats.  The plastic seems flimsy and I would worry about easily puncturing the bottom.You have to inflate each color individually.  My husband used an air compressor to inflate the pool and he says it only took him 10 minutes, it seemed longer to me so I will list his perception along with mine to be fair.  I just think it would be easier to only have to open, inflate, close one point rather than 4 points of the pool.Pros:The bottom of the pool has a drainage hole.  I doubt I would use this as a pool since my kids love it as a ball pit but the drain hole is a plus to have.  Keeps my options open.The price is a pro.  I think it was a priced fairly.  Any higher though I probably wouldn't have purchased.The size is very good for a kiddie pool.  My two year old, me and my 7 year old can sit in the ball pit and play without feeling cramped.  However, I am only 5' tall so I can technically be counted as kiddie size myself.I have had the item for a week and a half now.  My toddler's birthday party will be in two weeks, we'll see how the pool holds up with numerous toddlers climbing in and out of this...TBC...",1
"I had this set up in my daughter's crib when she was a baby.  It would light up the room just enough for her to feel comfortable but not so much that it kept her awake.  The music is very soothing and not as cartoony as you would think.  The unit would turn itself off after a period of time so I wouldn't have to creep back into the room hoping not to wake her.This is a wonderful crib toy.  I would recommend it for any newborn, especially those who have a hard time falling asleep.",1
"More than being a toy its a walker,,, first days i had to teached my child to use it, after few days she began to enjoy it, also parents remember that all confince your child need it comes from you, none was bornd with all knowledge, the walker works perfect at all, no defect, its well made it",1
"Ticket to Ride is a really easy and simple game to pick up and learn, but if you don't have any of the expansions to add more complexity, it's almost to simple for its own good as the replay value is greatly diminished, but I still like to pull it out and play it every once in awhile.",1
"This is a very sturdy, well-built little model with nice details that look very realistic.  My kids love absolutely playing with it.  I definitely recommend this toy!",1
"I remember playing this game 40 years ago with my sisters.  While the new version uses plastic beans instead of the real thing, it still delivers the same level of fun.",1
"What better (non-confrontational) way to get to know your family & friends better?!  This game of Loaded Questions is fun, entertaining and provides hours of great memories together!  Definitely would recommend for groups large and small!",1
"The bread looks goofy, but it's still better than other breads I've seen. The white bread looks super white (bleached out), the wheat bread is a dark brown. They're also harder than I thought. I thought as sandwich bread, they'd be a little bit more flexible, not rubbery or anything, but a little something to help make the sandwiches stay put. Salami paint job is poor, just looks like someone quickly speckled paint on it.",1
I got these for my three year old nephew who LOVES dinosaurs. I didn't know for sure how well he'd like them but they were a huge hit. He never put them down the whole day! He really liked them and they held his attention for quite a while which is hard to do--believe me! I was glad I bought them and would certainly recommend them. Melissa and Doug make great products and this was no exception!,1
"This was purchased as a birthday gift for a 4 year old.  It is wonderful, educational, and I never thought it would get a somewhat hyper little boy to actually sit down and play with it, but he absolutely loves it.  Wonderful gift.",1
"A good game for family interaction as the instructions aren't complicated, and children can easily pick up on how to play the game. Adults can team up with younger children and it still has the appeal for all to beat the opponents in gaining the correct amount of sequences to win.",1
"I got this for my son for his birthday when he was turning 7 and in the first grade. I was looking for something electronic to help him learn/practice multiplication and division before 2nd grade. The addition and subtraction were way to easy for him. He was at the time slighty above his piers in math.The multiplication mode goes in the same sequence which made him memorize rather then learn. He could spit out his multiplication tables in 1st grade after using the math shark, but I didn't get the feeling he understood what mutliplication was after using this product.I also don't feel it was good value for what he learned compared to so of teh other products out there.",1
And yes these are washable - like it says. It has a nice texture and easy for those inexperienced toddlers to use!,1
This is a great game for an evening with friends or family. Reasonably easy to learn. Can be a bit cut-throat at times. Has a chance at ending friendships.,1
We bought this for our son over 3 years ago.  He LOVES it! When he was younger he loved to spin it and hear the sounds and see the lights.  Now that he's older and learning his alphabet it has really been helping him with that.  And he overall just loves it because its a ball!  It is definitely a toy that will be handed down to our younger son now that he is becoming interested in toys and such.  Was very much worth the money for the amount of use and educational value that our children have and will continue to get from it.  Highly recommended!,1
"We bought this item on a friend's recommendation and were not disappointed.  The Ocean Wonders Aquarium is great for ages birth to one year+ because it offers soothing music (a nice selection of three tunes in very mellow chords) as well as optional muted lights and bubbles.  The only criticism we had is that the fish and other aquatic inhabitants in the box make a racket and you cannot turn them off like you can the music and lights; it's a though you are forced to listen to the plastic motion of the pieces over the soothing sounds of ocean waves, bubbles and/or music.  The price is about right for a crib toy and it's a sturdy unit so don't worry about breakage if your little one reaches out to touch.",1
My son went bonker's with this.  He even knows how to turn him on.  I only wish that it was the real chicken dance that he was teaching.,1
Bought this as a prize for an event.  I personally have not played it but the recipient was please to win it and had played before.,1
"My little princess loves playing this game and my son likes it too, a fun game to play for family night and on those rainny days when the little one can't go outside to play.",1
I purchased this for my grandson.  He was going through batteries so fast that we couldn't keep up with supply and demand.  The adaptor is a life saver and cuts down significantly and and the need for batteries.,1
"This is a great alternative to the turtle sandbox everybody seems to have in their yard. Our little guy has loved it this summer. Beware parents, the claws look like great places to sit, but only for the little people! My husband caved one side in that we just can't get to pop back out. Not a manufacturing flaw, though, just user error. We would highly recommend. Another quality product from Step2.",1
"these are fun for my 4 yo but we haven't been able to figure out how to make them all spin if you build horizontally. Also would be nice if they included more than one handle, just in case, you know, kids break things.",1
good foundation for buildings to remain in place and can transport creations easily.  10x10 is a good size and can be combined with other  plates to make a larger several buildings project.,1
I bought it for my 5 year old daughter. She loves at well as her father and I do too. It is easy to put together and to play.,1
"This is a nice game because my daughter can &#34;play for me&#34; while I am holding the baby or doing other things, since all players have the same goal.  She has not quite figured out she is playing alone at times (age 4)  As others have said, seems to have much less competition than a usual board game when we have multiple players.",1
"Bought this one on a whim with Pop Up Pirate so that there would be some ""easy"" and silly games in the house, and this one was an instant favorite for my 4YO and the family members that are frustrated by strategy games. Now they have 2 games they can play with her! I love it because the marbles stay in that plastic globe and aren't flying all over the place... And although it's kind of loud, it's NOTHING compared to the ""original"" Hungry Hippos, with 4 of those plastic things whacking away. And though she and I only play it a couple of times a week, it keeps a favorite place on our coffee table. Totally worth the price.",1
I could send my kids to college with the amount of money I've spend on these pieces of wood and plastic. Seriously how much does it cost to make one of these? 50 cents in wood and plastic? They turn around and sell them for 20.00+ in stores. (Amazon is slightly more reasonable)From a parent's perspective DON'T let your kids get addicted to Thomas and Friends unless you're well off.I gave it 5 stars thou because my kid goes GAGA over these things.. C'est la vie,1
"Santa brought this set for my girls and they really love it. This set is made of realistic quality materials and is so much fun! They love slicing the bread opening the containers to spread on the bread and stacking the sandwich. I enjoy them serving me, since all their food is delicious!",1
"We purchased this game for our young daughters for a Christmas gift and they love it.  It is a throwback to when we were growing up and playing Perfection.  The quality seems fine for the price we paid and has held up well.  The game is so much fun for the little ones and they love trying to get all the pieces in the right spots before the game ""pops"" and everything flies out.  They jump every time and always laugh.  The get such a kick out of it.  I even found that my 3 year old had pulled out the game by herself last week and was just sitting there putting all the shapes in the spaces without the timer going... just having fun and entertaining herself.  It was great.We purchased this game for $10 around Christmas time (which is a good sale).  The regular price is probably around $20 from WalMart or Target.  At the time of this review, the price was $34 on Amazon from Secondary Amazon Merchants.  That is way overpriced.  It is a fun game, but shop around and try to get a price that is less than $20-$25.All in all, this is a really fun game for the kids... and for parents on game night.  It is a challenge and results in a lot of fun and a lot of laughs.  Highly Recommended!",1
"We love card games---well, most any games---and this one is no exception.  It is fun, addicting and the tables can turn at any moment.If you love a quick card game that doesn't necessarily rely on skill but just luck and paying attention, you will LOVE THIS!",1
My friends and I are huge Twilight fans so we could not wait to play this game.  I previously purchased the New Moon boardgame which was dissapointing because the questions were really easy and the game was not all that fun - so we were really hoping that Scene It would fullfil our desire for a fun Twilight Game - which it totally did!  The game plays like a typical Scene It game with both DVD questions and questions on the card.  There are two dice included - one with numebers and one with pictures of the different challeges.  It can also be played on half of a board - or you can expand the board for more players and depending on the amount of time that you have.  The only complaint that I have about the game is the board itself - it is flimsy and did not unfold into a flat position so the game pieces would not stand up.My friends and I really enjoyed this game - the questions were challenging which made it really entertaining.  It contained a ton of clips from all 3 movies.  There are also bonus features on the DVD such as Party Play - which is just continuous questions with no stopping.  We had so much fun with this game and can't wait to have our next Twilight Night.  Definately pick this up if you are a fan of the series.  Please note that the questions are all based on the movies and not the books.,1
"I love this fishbowl. My baby just seems to take the balls out and walk around with them without any regards to the bowl, but now she is one and we are just learning to put things back in. So she should be playing with the fishbowl and the balls. At first, we would take the balls with us to playgroups, because she wouldn't put them down. And the flutter characters inside delighted all the other babies. I recommend this. I has plays such nice music and the batteries really last.",1
"Adorable little elf!  My children really enjoyed him, and the book that came with him.  They actually wanted to go to bed at night so they could go search for &#34;Rusty&#34; in the morning.  They were very sad to see him go back to Santa when Christmas was over.  Very fun little Christmas game to play with your children, and a wonderful tradition to pass down to their children.",1
"This is a really fascinating toy!  And, it's much more durable than it looks.  We still try to be careful with it, but it has taken some normal kid abuse and handled it well.  I use it at church to indicate when the children should sing louder or softer, and they are all fascinated with it.  It really is a suitable gift for any person age 2 to 112.  So fun!",1
"This toy has been great for helping my daughter learn how to better use her fine motor skills.  I think the toy was designed to have different levels of strength and coordination needed to pop up each one of the animals.  This would make sense, as it provides additional value for the children.  What good would the toy be if it only developed one specific motor skill?  Eventually my daughter was able to master activating each one of the animals, and it took about 5-6 months.  We got it for her when she was about 8 months old.  The easiest one for her to master was the circle button (panda), as it requires only a simple press.  The second one she mastered was the left to right slider (giraffe), although at first she could only operate it when the it when sliding it from right to left, as she has to use the edge of the toy to get enough leverage to move the slider.  Third was the rocking switch (monkey), which is similar to the slider switch, albeit slightly different and requiring a bit different type of coordination to activate.  Fourth was the up and down switch (elephant).  She was able to master pulling the switch down fairly quickly, but learning to push it up took a bit longer.  Finally, the turn-key switch (lion) was the last to be mastered.  It requires a good amount of force at the end to activate the pop-up mechanism, but I don't think that's a bad thing.  I think it helps the children progress as they are developing, learning step by step.The only ""negative"" I have found with this is that if you drop it, sometimes the toys pop up.  It has survived a plethora of droppings, and is quite durable.  All the switches still work perfectly.",1
"very pleased with this set. I do wish the juice, bacon, egg and pancake were a little smaller (just so they'd fit her kitchen better) but she doesn't care.",1
"My 2-year-old loves this cart. It is very strong and easy to push on carpet and tile. Holds a lot, has a basket up front for her doll to ride along! Highly recommend for little shoppers :-)",1
"I got this toy to use in my church nursery for my toddler Sunday School class.  They love it!  We use it to act out Biblical Voyages, such as Moses crossing the red sea.  This is one of their favorite toys!  They love chasing each other through it and hiding in it.  It is easy to clean up, just collapse it and tie the nylon ties closed.  It has been smooshed, jumped on, and used by a LARGE 10-year old, and no damage has been done!  I am very happy with this item.It is 6 Feet long, the picture on this site shows two tunnels locked together - take the picture, divide it by two, and that is the product you are purchasing",1
Same old toy with curious George which grand daughter likes better then clowns.Same old tune so not that much different from what you had.,1
"You will have hours of fun with this game as you try to simultaneously make your family more miserable as you increase the happiness of other players'families.  With characters like red-headed stepchild, what's not to love? Plus, the cards are made of a durable plastic, so no matter how much you play, they do not become  worn.  Overall, a very fun toy for adolescents and adults. The directions may be too complex for children.",1
"Perfect for a 5 year old, not too big and definitely not too small. I can't wait for my son to try this out.",1
"This is like twister in a way -- the mat has the letters (in alphabetical order) around the outside, and the object is for the child to put different body parts on the right letters (selected from the &#34;tornado&#34; spinner).  There are 5 letters or free spaces each time -- feet, hands, and ear.  It doesn't specify which hand, which is good.  The kids will be twisted up trying to get their ear on the &#34;m&#34; and hands on the &#34;a&#34; and &#34;b&#34;!  Mat is a thick, sturdy plastic, adults and children have played on it with no issues.",1
"If you are just starting out are want one for inside this is the one. I was blown away had easy it was to fly. It hovers great and Handel's like my high dollar one I have. So for the money you can't go wrong. It can take a hit and keep on going. I thought at first that something this little would be a joke but I was very wrong. When they built this one they got it wright. Give it a try I promise you it will be a blast. And it will bring the kid out of you, and there is nothing wrong with that.Syma S107/S107G  R/C Helicopter - Red",1
"So my greatest concern was whether our larvae would make it to us alive and they did.  They are growing so fast!  And I'm so glad some reviewers mentioned having to order the larvae after you buy this garden, well it made sense but it didn't occur to me before then.  I ordered ours online for $3 and they arrived in just a few days.  My son is almost 4 and really doesn't like bugs but he really is enjoying this!  Assume all of the larvae grew to beatiful butterflies unless I follow up and report otherwise!  And BTW I got the butterfly garden for $13 on amazon.",1
"This toy is wonderful. The item description provided is exact. It teaches letters, phonics, spelling, and writing. It even teaches BOTH lower case and upper case letters! Especially neat; when your child presses a letter, for instance D, it says the letter D than the phonics sound (if you have the switch set to phonics) and then the little screen clearly shows just how to write the letter properly. I plays a couple song notes as it shows the first line being drawn downward then up and into the curve for the letter D. Then, it invites the child to write the letter D in the writing space below. As the child writes, it continues to display the correct motions to write the letter D properly so that the beginner child can easily copy the motion. My 3-year olds first attempt was definately messy but you could see her concentrating on copying the screen and you could see the 'rough outline' of the attempted letter. This is a great toy. Traditionally, these electronic toys have not been taken out much at our home. However, I feel this will be used. And I have recently discovered that the electronic toys like this that fit on a lap work perfect in the car. They don't have to compete there with trucks and little 'busy toys', your child is occupied and learning something without much to divert him/her, and you can travel in peace-for a time. You simply can't go wrong with this toy.",1
"I bought this for my nephew.  It's a little smaller then I expectd, but very cute, none the less.  Easy to operate.  My nephew has some learning disabilities so this simple to use remote fire truck is perfect for him, it's not complex but still a fun remote truck.",1
Great puzzle. I set up a station of different types of puzzles and art stations for a three year old birthday. It went over great with parents and kids...,1
"These are just great. They are true to measurements, and we used them to top a table for our son.  Now he has a great little Lego workstation.",1
We bought this for my daughter when she was 3.  We played it over and over again because it was simple to play and very educational.,1
This top is makes pretty images when spinned and it seems to be very durable.  My 2 yr. old grandson loves it and was able to spin it fast very quickly!  He loves it and it certainly was worth the money.  Very cute!!,1
"This butterfly garden saw so much use over the years for all manner of critters, not just butterflies. It finally dry-rotted from so much time outside but we sure did get our money's worth out of it!",1
"My kids got this game for Christmas and so far we love it. I don't get all these bad reviews. My daughter who is almost 6 absolutely loves it. It's a fun game. As far as people complaining that it takes too long to roll a 6, well that's part of the game. Who get's all the sixes first and completes their cootie. Anyway, when my daughter and I play it doesn't take long at all to get the sixes. We just go fast when rolling the dice.Update: Okay so after a while I did get tired of playing this game. Strangely the first few times we played it, we seemed to get the needed parts rather quickly but now we have to roll it so many times just to get one part that it starts to get boring.",1
We have only played with this one time but I think it is great.  My two year old son had fun helping put the pieces together.,1
Very nice to use with magnet letters and practice spelling. Holds the letters great and folds together nicely for storage. You can use it on a table or even the floor.,1
"This was the only thing I asked for from my in-laws for Christmas for my toddler. Of course they didn't listen to me so I bought it myself and I am SO GLAD I did. My daughter LOVES it and I can SEE her balance improving every time she jumps on Rody. The second we had it out of the package and blown up with a bike pump, she jumped right on and started singing. It's still a favorite exercise toy. This was such a GREAT purchase! I was hesitant, because $50 is a lot for a kid's toy but she LOVES it. Some of the reviews mention a plasticy smell but that was completely gone in less than a day. It's very sturdy and seems like it will last a long time.",1
"Another ball! Who doesn't love balls? I sure love balls. We have balls all over my house...big balls, little balls, balls balls balls. This was a good addition to our ball collection.",1
My son loves this toy. Hes in his banging stage (6 months) and he knows that when he bangs on the drum it will make noise and play music.  He really loves this drum.,1
"Since we got this wagon, we have used it constantly with our 1 and 2 year-old sons.  I agree that the door is somewhat inconvenient to open, but my 2-year old can do it with no problem, so it obviously isn't that bad.  The seatbelts are great, as my 1 year-old is very active.  I don't have to worry about him squirming out (which he does in other seatbelts).  The wheels are large and durable, so going over bumps or over grass is not bad at all.  My kids like to sit in it even if we aren't going anywhere, and it is so cool that other kids have actually fought over who was going to get to sit inside when we were at the park with friends one day.  This is a must-have for parents with small children!",1
"Awesome toy. My 4 year old has played with it a lot, and we've had several neighborhood kids come over to join in, even the teenagers who initially hung back to ''watch'' couldn't resist joining in eventually. It's so much fun. It's cheaply made, the markup on it must be huge - but I'd buy it again anyway. The down side is I've been on the roof three times and had to fish the rockets out of trees twice -- the up side is that they're so light weight that they eventually just fall down if you can't be bothered to get them yourself.",1
"My daughter just turned two, so she is too young to use it as a memory game.  She likes to match the cards when they are faces up.  I break it down to 9 pairs at a time so it is not too overwhelming.",1
If you love Scene it and Twilight you can't go wrong here!  This has the first three movies combined in it with the classic scene it game style.  Me and my sisters and girlfriends love it!,1
"We love this game - two yr olds to 80 yr olds can play and have a chance at winning their first time. No reading required to play, a wide variety of expansions to add on if you like it. We play a lot of games, but this one stands the test of time.",1
"Every single thing in here makes noise, and what could be more fun for little ones than driving their parents nuts with noisy musical instruments?",1
"Someone called this a mix of Edward Gorey meets Addams Family and that's dead on for the presentation and art work. It's a fun card game with not only a fantastically beautiful look and feel, but also a clever use of transparent cards and a great sense of humor on the cards...leaving room for you and your friends to add your own darkly amusing plot points. Tons of fun, original, and great replay value as a card game.",1
My daughter outgrew this toy and was very sad.  She played and played and played with this last summer when she 18 months.  She took her baby doll everywhere with her on this. It's very durable and the wheels go on sidewalks or the grass just as well.  She mostly used this in the back yard. She still wants to play with it but she is a very big 21/2 year old and her legs are really not comfortable.I would reccommend this for any little girl not yet ready for a trike.,1
I cut the spinner out and take this game on plane trips (we fly a lot).  My 1 year old and my 3.5 year old will play this for a long time during flights.  Lots of fun and silly-ness!,1
"My daughter got this set when she was three.  She LOVED it then and amazingly 3 years later still loves it!  This item is kept at her Grandmother's house.  She is there usually one - two times a week.  My daughter plays with this set every time she is there.  She loves serving everyone tea when we visit.  The music in the teapot adds to the fun.I think this tea set is much better than just a plain set (without sound effects).  Very durable too!We picked one up this year for our little neice who is three for Christmas.  We hope she enjoys it as much as our daughter!  AND, let's face it, you can't beat the price!",1
This is first board game that my 3 and 4 years old kids can sit through and actually enjoy. They are more in to active dramatic play and not so much sitting down play. But this game is quick and fun enough to keep them interested for up to 20 minutes of play. I am very happy. Thanks to this game they show interest in other board games now.,1
I have started to add to my grandson's Thomas collection of engines by now purchasing interesting train cars.  He loves all of them.,1
Simple fun game that lets the player work on his own yet has a sense of competition.  Much faster than Scrabble and lets you rearrange the tiles as your letters change.  They are two different games; people are going to like one more than the other.  I like Bannanagrams best.,1
"My son, aka ""LEGO fanatic', uses these all the time.  He has plenty of project sets the are self sufficient (like the Star Wars type sets for example) but is always making additional scenarios and structures that make great use of the base plate.  His favorite projects are building galactic fleet space ships from random bits and building, well buildings.  The buildings definitely needs a base such as this to maintain their structural integrity...my husband claims they are a little too flexible, but my son says they are perfect.  I consider my son the subject-matter expert and defer to his opinion.  His other opinion is (I believe) that he would like one about 10 feet x 10 feet.  Oh well.This is a great product for the LEGO fans when they start going off on wild tangents and building random things...it falls under the category of 'can't have too many of these'.HIGHLY recommended!JTG",1
We have been playing this game for a few years.  I have given many games to others as we have taught them how to play it.  I always keep a spare one on hand.,1
"Our daughter received this tea set as a Christmas gift - at 20 months. She has loved it and plays with it every day. When our family or friends come over they even joke they are going to be sick on ""tea"", because she loves to pour a cup for anyone who visits. The set is very durable. She drops it, and steps on it, and no problems. The tray with grooves for each item is wonderful because it helps her steady it when she carries it around, plus it helps her pick it up at the end of a tea party. I also love the fact that you can actually put water in this set. There are no holes for it to leak out of, and no electronics to worry about ruining. She loves to carefully prepare a tea party, and then invite her stuffed animals or anyone who will come, and serve them. It really works her imagination. This truly is one of the best toys our daughter has ever had. She loves it, and I would recommend it to anyone.",1
This is one of my sons favorite toys. It comes with 5 balls. It makes great sounds. He loves to press the buttons and then dance to the groovy music. There isn't an on off switch so you can't turn the music off. Also this is hard to assemble. Fisher price could have done better with the instructions. It doesn't tip over very easly. It will tip with enough force applied but it is sturdier then many toys I've seen. The decals are a pain in the back to aplly as well. In spite all of this I would buy this toy for any yound children I know.,1
This is really a fun and educational game. Just a couple minutes into playing I knew it was going to be good.  I just brought three more games for my mother and sisters!,1
I've used this toy for two of my three kids and they both love winnie the pooh as much as I do. My daughter won't go to sleep without it. I like that it plays music for a couple of minutes so it can help her relax.  I also like that I can turn it on or off while I'm outside of her room.  She also learned how to turn it on by herself so she can here it whenever she wants.,1
I got these stickers for my grand children - not necessarily for them but for ME! LOL - I mail them little notes and I put these stickers on the note and on the envelopes. So cute and so worth the price of putting a big smile on the little faces. So cute! It's the little things in life that mean so very much.,1
"I specifically got on amazon today just to write a review for this purchase!  This cash register is awesome!  My daughter received this as a Xmas gift this year & she has been playing with ever since.  I love the fact that it is solar powered, no need for batteries.  The noises it makes, the play money, the look of the register, all looks real.  This is a must have for any grocery store and I promise your kids will love it.",1
"We bought this globe for our 4 and 5 year old kids.  It is your basic world globe with all of the countries, continents, oceans, etc. labeled.  It was held up great and even though the base is made out of plastic, it does not tip over easily.  I would recommend this product.",1
"My son was given this at age 1 for Xmas. By 2 years old he was able to sing the alphabet song & recognize every letter. I was shocked at 18 mo when he announced we were next to a ""UPS"" truck on the road!I read to him , but had not worked with him on his alphabet. He learned it from this toy.Each little figure plays a different verse of the Wheels on the Bus song when placed in the socket. It can also be switched so they speak or play an instrument. He just loves this toy.This is a wonderful toy that has held his attention for countless hours over the last year. It is now being handed down to his brother & after many droppings & bangings....looks & works like new. The batteries also last a very long time.Great toy......",1
"We bought this for long car trips with kids (didn't like the kids' version as much).  We are happy with the variety -- and quantity -- of questions.  We have yet to use it, but think it will work fine.  We can't imagine ever using the board and playing this as a board game; we'll just ask the questions.",1
"For a fantasy game fan, just browsing Fantasy Flight Games' catalog can be comparable to an alcoholic strolling around a liquor store: Too many choices, intriguing all.  As I've been using what spare time I can muster to methodically sample various treats from said catalog, Kingsburg has been on my ""to do"" list for quite some time.  In a recent ""free-shipping induced"" online ordering binge, I finally slapped ol Kingsburg into the virtual cart with high, if somewhat hazy, expectations.Low and behold, after several close rounds of play, I am pleased to report that Fantasy Flight has managed to put out another winner in the fantasy board game genre, this one a combination of resource management, basic combat, and opponent-oriented strategy.If, like me, you find yourself attempting to make some sort of logical game play assessment based exclusively on the back of the box's description paired to photos of the (seemingly insanely complex) game in play, let me begin by putting your mind at ease.  The game is deceptively intuitive after only a full 90-minute play, perhaps even earlier than that but by the second full game, you'll find yourself referring to the 8-page rulebook less and less.True to the teasers, you assume the role of one of the king's governors in a land with apparently very invade-able borders.  The idea of the game is to come out furthest on the board's outermost scoring track at the conclusion.  Pacing the flow of things is both a seasonal and annual counter (4 seasons per year/ 5 years total game time).  Not to worry if five years sounds like an awful big commitment, a table of experienced players will enjoy complete game times between a little over an hour to an hour and a half maximum.I mentioned resource management and indeed, that element represents the core of the game play mechanic as dice rolls determine which of the king's royal court will toss a few goodies in your direction (these goods range from gold to building supplies to soldiers).  Each turn (season), players allocate their resources to constructing buildings, building up their army, or just stockpiling materials for later use.  The catch is each year come wintertime; the malevolent forces from outside the land's borders come a knocking.  Players who neglected to prep their armies during spring, summer and autumn will pay severe consequences should they falter to the invading orcs, barbarians, zombies, and dragon forces.This all sounds terribly complex, I'm sure and photos of the game board with its depicted hierarchy of characters, dozens of in-play dice, markers, chips, and player sheets does little to dissuade the notion.  However, after a few minutes of actual playtime, it becomes very clear that whoever designed the board initially had an outstanding perception of the game's intricacies as nothing, and I mean nothing, on it is without purpose.  Markers keep track of everything from the given season and year (remember there's only 5 total), to which player gets to roll first in a given season, to the precise payouts each advisor provides, to how many soldiers you've got recruited into your army.  All of the building construction is kept separate from the board on the player's individual province sheets.  Hard commodities such as gold bars, wood, and stone are represented by appropriately painted wooden blocks.  The more familiar with the game one becomes, the more he comes to appreciate the detail and amount of information the game board contains on every square inch throughout.The rules themselves are pretty clearly presented so long as you don't make the mistake of attempting to comprehend them without the actual game components set up before you.  I found that the quickest and easiest method to get underway was to actually follow the setup section precisely and to actually go through all of the motions on the board for a full year (4 seasons) along with the step by steps of the instructions.  After which, starting over for an official game begins to feel quite intuitive.  Fortunately the rules are presented in a very orderly fashion, complete with full color examples for nearly any situation, making quick reference to iron out the rough spots very convenient.The pieces and bits are typical Fantasy Flight Games which is to say beautifully illustrated, constructed of unprecedented quality, and come within a box loaded with plastic storage compartments to insure that everything fits neatly within.  Setup is quite minimal and in this case limited to a bit of card sorting, stacking up some wooden blocks, and retrieving the tokens, wooden markers, and wooden dice to correspond with your chosen color.The game's greatest strength perhaps is its practice of not pitting players directly against one another but rather as individuals against the rigors of the kingdom.  Decision making and resource allocation factor heavily upon the game's outcome over luck of the draw elements or random card flipping.  In the end it's basically a player versus other player(s) situation even though it rarely feels like it during the course of play.  I'm pleased to report that there's very little in the way of punishment or trickery to opponents.  Again, players will find themselves quite involved in managing their own affairs, which is appropriate since it is their own decisions throughout that ultimately determine the game's winner.In all, Kingsburg is a fantastic entry in a saturated market and further proof that Fantasy Flight Games is quite serious about their craft.  Highly recommended entertainment!",1
I noticed the numbers on all the engines so I bought this one so I could make it so my son could count the engines from 1-10.  This is number 3.  Only the coal cars are marked.  This is a large engine.  It's size makes it difficult to push around and it derails easily.  My son is 16 moths old and has trouble with this engine I recommend it if for the 2+ crowd.,1
"Its nice, tough, handles light wind condition, everthing as described. Good little quadcopter. Would recommend the upgradeable battery for longer flying time.",1
9 year old loves this!!!  Instructions included to create books online too.,1
"This pool has taken a beating and no leaks yet.  Bought it for my son's 6y bday party.  The weather didn't cooperate so it became a ball pit, but is now functioning as a pool. The extra height and air-cushioned bottom makes it possible to jump in as a ball pit butt-first without getting hurt.  It is now under a zip line and again, just deep enough to drop into from a safe height cannon-ball style, yet easy for an average 5yo to get in and out of.  My only wish for this pool and others is to have a dark colored bottom surface so they will absorb more heat from the sun and make the water warmer.",1
Cute and affordable tea set.  Plastic so it doesn't break or chip!  Color changing which adds to toddlers creativity and imagination!  Durable which makes you feel good about your purchase in this economy.  My daughter loves it.  She plays with it daily and requires water each time!  It has helped with her verbal skills (we chat during tea time!) and hand eye coordination.,1
"I am a teacher and I use this game with my kids at school all the time.  They LOVE it from grade school to high school depending on how you use it.I don't really follow the rules that came with it, only the values of how the pigs land.  I have used it often in an afterschool tutoring program were we often practice math facts and addition.  I took the instruction sheet from the game, found the place where they have the pigs drawn and what the rolls are worth, enlarged it on the copier so all the kids (usually less than 6) can see it at the same time (and of course, colored the pig drawings pink!)  Then each student rolls, finds what his roll is worth, and adds his score.  The first to pass 100 points wins.  We sometimes start with 100 and subtract our score -- the first to zero (or less) wins.  We have played where I announce at the beginning of the round that ""This roll will be multiplied by 7""..the kids all cheer ""Come on doule razorback!""  I was amazed how fast they learned what each roll was worth.  I would have liked to try something with fractions, but my study group wasn't ready for that.  (For example, you could make each roll worth a certain fraction and they would have to add them up at the end of the game.)We have also used it to study for tests.  I ask them a question and if they get it right, they get to roll.  I am sure you could adapt it to lots of subjects.  It is just a fun way to do rote things with a little more fun.I have also used it with younger kids who cannot add yet.  I drew them a 100 square (a little block about 3""x3"" divided into 10x10 grid) and made a bunch of copies.  Then they roll, find their score on the scoresheet, then color in that many squares with a marker.  Nice counting practice, and visual of how much different coloring in 20 is from coloring in only 5.  I sometimes ask them ""Look at your paper and at Joe's.  Who has more squares colored in?  How many do you need to catch up?""edit 5-1-13: I posted a copy of my scoresheet under customer images. It still is a favorite game of mine!I really don't see any problem with the competing, and I sort of like the added benefit of learning HOW TO LOSE (which few seem to know) and other sportsmanship behaviors.The only problem I have seen with the game is that the little black dot (on one side of the pig) wears off and I have to keep drawing it on with a sharpie.  Also, after about a year, their little piggy tails are hardly hanging on.  I need a new set.GET THE GAME....have fun, change the rules, make up new ones...the pigs are the motivation...you decide what you want them to learn from it.  OR learn nothing and just play.  You'll like it.",1
"My son received this car for his 2nd birthday and was an instant hit!  He enjoyed playing with the walkie talkie and running around all over the yard and house with it.  His sister would pile in next to him just for the ride.  This is the same great quality as the yellow/orange car but with a couple of extra features.  My son is into trucks, fire trucks, police cars so this was a perfect gift for him.  He loves to tell people that the real police have a car LIKE HIS!  In a yrs time we have had no problems with this toy and is still in great condition - the only problem we have ever had is my son wants it in the house so he can play with it when it's raining or snowing out!  Another great product from Little Tikes.",1
I had found memories of having this as a child and thought my son would love it. And love it he did for a day and like so many things a day is all there is. He has played with it a few times and we play together running through the house but he tires of it quickly!Well it works as I remember and does everything it is supposed to.,1
"Carassconne is one of the best board games available.  First of all, it is very simple to learn.  This is one of the few games in my collection that I can play when my non-gamer friends come over.  It just takes a minute to explain and after the first game, I find that most people can pick it up.  It has a high replay value as well because each game will turn out differently.  No two game boards turn out the same.  This is thanks to the very interesting tile laying game mechanic.If you're only familiar with American-style board games like Monopoly or Risk, do yourself a favor and pick this up.  You'll see that there is a whole new way to think about boardgaming.",1
these are expensive for what you get. the small amount of paint is top notch though. lots of colors. the yellow matches my j3 cub really well which was a nice suprise,1
"I love anything related to Monty Python and this game does not let down on that front at all, every card is related to Monty Python. If you like games that basically have no strategic point and almost no ability to predict what is going to happen at all then you will like this game. If you like strategy and planning you will be frustrated by the randomness in this game. It is hilarious and if you have a fun game group you will like this! Fun.",1
"My kids use these a lot, but rarely the way the game is designed, they are always pla food!  They're very cute and durable!",1
"This is a great toy to help teach cause and effect. My little girl would always play with this toy when we went shopping so eventually I broke down and bought her one, and she loves it! She loves naming all the animals and the numbers and she likes to push/pull/turn the knobs to make them appear. Overall a great toy that is super durable (she likes to drop things still) so I would definitely recommend it!",1
"My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep.  This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out.  The new quests, intrigue, and building cards are great.  Adds some new fun ways to play.  I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though.  Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible.  My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play.  I'm sure other people have been thinking the same.... But other than these new lords, the new game play is fun!",1
"This is my kids favorit game, and my favorit to play with them. It goes fast and you can stop at any time. You don't have to sit around wating for your turn and you don't have to remind your kids that it is there turn. Every one plays at the same time. It can get a little loud with all the shouting. It is a realy easy concept to understand. My 6 year old can play it just fine. It is best to play with at least four people. I love the fact that this game is almost 100 years old. You know it must be good if it's still around.",1
"if your looking for disney tv shows, then you need to get the disney channel one, all this has his child cartoon movies like the lion king, wall-e, toy story, up, ect. the gameplay isnt to complex, and theirs a pary mode that alows you to just do the video part. if youve played scene-it? before this is the same as the others.",1
"This Syma ""S107G"" R/C helicopter works great and is a lot of fun since it is so easy to control, even for the complete novice. We picked one of these up for my son's birthday and had it up and flying very quickly. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Easy To Control; very short learning curve to figuring out how to fly this+ Durable; has held up to quite a few ""operator error"" induced crashes+ Fun; really, just fun to flyCons -- Charging; need to keep an eye on the charger since it doesn't stop when ""full""- I/R Control; this is not radio controlled but rather infrared, so you a clear ""line of sight"" between the controller and the helicopterOverall, we are very pleased with this very cool and fun toy! Might just have to get one for myself too!Highly Recommended!CFH",1
"I got this as a Christmas gift for my daugheter and she loves it! It was VERY easy to assemble and seems pretty durable. The only thing is the seat that the doll sits it is a bit flimsy and slips so they doll falls out. My daughter gets frustrated with this, but I think I can easily attach a simple strap to hold the doll in.",1
"Purchasing this toy is simply throwing money away.  I am astounded at the amount of things breaking on this stable, and the companion truck/trailer set my daughter was given as a gift.  The concept and look is great, and the opportunities could have been endless for play if my daughter was not bringing pieces to me one by one from these sets.  She is 5 years old and gentle with her toys, but this toy simply can not handle being played with even as intended.  There are things we can fix, like the cupola or roof shifting/falling off, but it is also beyond repair where gate/door hinges break.  We were without receipts for this item or it would have gone back the first day when the breaking began.  We have had a much better experience the Schleich jeep and trailer purchased for her 3 year old sister, but have not found a similar sized stable.  Again, these Breyer accessories are a waste of money for use as a toy being so poorly constructed.",0
"This cheap little helicopter was pretty fun but didn't last.My 5 year old pretty much destroyed it. I know, not rated for a 5 year old but I only let him play with it after the tail rotor wouldn't spin.Figured how much damage could he do going up and down.Well, turns out quite a bit. Anyways its cheap.Its cheap, did I mention that?",0
"What a boring toy.Here you have a sturdy dual twisting set of ramps.  The slightest touch sets off an irritating electronic noise (presumably of race cars whizzing past) that you cannot turn off (Fisher-Price seems to have a thing against on-off switches on its toys).Placing two plastic race cars at the top of the ramps and starting them sends them spiraling downward at a rapid pace with the said noise reverberating around your eardrums.  If your child is playing with this on a carpet, the cars roll ahead about 4 inches; if he/she is playing on a hard floor, they roll a whopping 8 inches forward.  If you are not careful, the lightweight cars will end up underneath the sofa or TV stand, making them impossible to find again.Doesn't this sound exciting?I tried very hard to get my son interested in this playset.  I set up the cars, ""revved"" the engines, and asked him to race my car.He ignored me and continued playing with his Mega Blocks.On the rare times he paid attention to this dud, he would try and race his Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars down the ramps, but they were too large.  Only the two cars that come with this set work.Most of the time, this toy sits in his playroom unused.  It is marked for the garage sale pile this spring.",0
"I and my 4 year old son haven't found this game to be that much fun, but I've found it to be of poor quality as parts fit loosely or too tight (heads may easily fall off the body) and male attachment parts too easily break off and get left in the holes.Also, ""MADE IN MEXICO WITH DIE MADE IN CHINA"".",0
"To begin with, it is difficult to install the batteries. And in less than a week, the remote stopped to work. I got new batteries installed still no luck. I should have read the reviews before I purchased this. It's a total waste of money.",0
This is what happens when a company decides that they can make much more money by re-making a very popular game as cheaply  as possible (made in china) and then charging more for it. I ordered the game that is pictured and was willing to pay the $20 price tag because my grandkids have one and love it. What I received from School Specialty was &#34;the new and improved&#34; cheaply made version that sells at Walmart for $6. Stay away from this Hasbro disaster.,0
"I would pay one buck for something like this because it reminds me of a dollar store item. The clip on the back that helps stand the clock upright is flimsy, cheap and constantly falls out. I'm going to have to glue it in with D6000. As for function - you just move the minute hand around and the hour hand will move appropriately with it. Okay that's fine but I can make a paper clock do the same thing and spend pennies. Overall not happy at all with this product. I thought it was larger and had more function (the latter my own fault for not reading more carefully). I see other reviewers have said theirs have loosened or won't tell the correct time anymore so I have that to look forward to in the near future, I'm sure. My advice - visit the dollar store, make your own or splurge for a better clock.",0
"I don't like writing negative reviews, and I have a lot of Melissa and Doug products that I think are great. But right out of the box the paint was peeling off all the puzzles, and worst of all they had an overpowering, terrible odor that made my head ache. I don't want my children, or anyone else, inhaling that odor on a regular basis. I love the idea of this toy and would have kept it even with the chipped paint, but I couldn't get past how badly it smelled, and returned it. Perhaps the odor might dissipate over time but that's not very comforting to me. Really disappointing. I will say I have not had this happen with other Melissa and Doug products, maybe this was just a bad batch.",0
"I bought these to replace a different set of pattern blocks. These don't work with the cards as they are much smaller, I'm sure I'll find a use sometime, but I was really disappointed",0
"The organs and bones snap in to hold them in place, problem is it doesn't stay. its such a tight fit, one part snaps in causing a chain reaction of other parts popping out. With these distractions the teaching focus is lost and quickly becomes more a puzzle project than a teaching opportunity; net-net, not a good teaching tool. Its also much smaller than I thought it would be.  We returned it.",0
Terribly designed; we couldn't even make it through one game before it broke. Save your money and buy something of better quality instead.,0

"I have 4 kids, 6 yr old, 4 yr old twins and an infant. I wanted something that the older 3 could play together, and something simple and fast. This was definitely something they could have fun with but they cannot play with it without an adult. The plastic pieces of the main body don't fit tight together so if you knock it around, it wobbles and could fall apart. The sticks are flimsy/bendy. When you stick it through the wholes, they bend depending on which hole you put it in (if not aligned properly). And then when there are a lot of sticks already, putting the last few sticks in is a little tougher. Sometimes some of the sticks just fall out so I sort of have to ""stitch"" other sticks in to make sure it's over and under the others so it doesn't just fall out on it's own.There is a little basin on the bottom for each player. So the tube body part rotates so that when the marbles fall, it falls on that player's basin. But the frustrating thing is, the whole tube body is wobbly. Just by rotating it, the balls could fall through and mess up the game. So this job isn't for little hands. I have to sit with the kids and rotate it for each player.The other frustrating thing is there is no way to store the game without the marbles and sticks falling out. The box it came in is not a hard one so it's destroyed once opened. Then the pieces don't just stack properly in order to just put the marbles and sticks together. There's just no way easy way of storing it so the pieces don't get lost.",0
"I wish I had bothered to read the reviews before ordering this game. Paid $ 40 to get the &#34;original&#34; version of this game and instead got the so called updated version which has large holes and rubbish items to take out and that's it.Applied to return it but couldn't without talking to customer service. After explaining the problem she said she would issue a return slip and send the game I had ordered, which by then had gone up an incredible $ 20  to $ 60. She did agree though I should have it at the original price I ordered it for and was going to issue a $ 20 credit to my account.I presumed the matter was sorted until two days after when I received the exact same game from Amazon. I again could not return the game without talking to customer service but was unable to explain anything more than I wanted to return the game. The fact I still wanted to order the original game did not sink in with the cs agent. The agent merely commiserated with me when I said I still wanted the game and could I get it through Amazon or not as so far it didn't seem likely. The &#34;I understand how you feel&#34; comment I got made me decide to give up, particularly when, as I was chatting with the cs agent I noted that in the last two days the price again had risen by another $ 10.I've now bought it through Ebay, at least I hope I have. It's a shame as I never had an unpleasant experience with Amazon before.",0
"We received this as a gift, and the idea sounded cute.  HOWEVER, you have to wack the dolphins really hard to get them to make any noise.  Also, the rings are nearly impossible for a 2-year-old to put together, and they fall apart almost immediately.  We never use it in the bathtub...it's too frustrating and takes up quite a bit of room.  My son did like it in his wading pool.  But it's basically just another floating toy.",0
This game is not as well made as we older people remember it. One of the heads on the hippos will not even lift up when the lever is pushed and one of them will not retract after the lever is pushed. My daughter likes it if we are the only ones playing because two of them do work. But it does not work like I remember it.,0
This thing went right in the trash two day's after installation. Maybe I didn't follow the directions properly. dunno.,0
"My 12 month old daughter received this for her birthday.  I was initally thrilled with the welcomed new classical tunes (all of which are very pleasant to listen to).  The toy has two modes, one that plays the whole song(s) and one that plays part of it and stops until the baby moves the toy again to get it going.  THis mode also will make sounds if the toy is not jiggled within a minute or so.  Sadly, I was disapointed in this toy because it doesn't automatically shut off which I thought was very silly.  Thus the toy will remind you that it's still on FOREVER!!  So it doesn't make a nice crib toy becasue she can't turn it on or off by herself (you have to flip a hidden switch to get it on and off)and will play all night if you let it. Finally, my daughter wasn't particularly interested in the toy anyway.  Thus I had to give low stars on fun & education since she wasn't drawn to it to play or learn, though the music IS very nice. As for durability, the thing is like new since she doesn't touch it.  Didn't do it for us.",0
"My daughter got this toy when she was 14 months old.  I can't figure out why she gets bored with it so easily.  She won't pay attention to this toy for more than one minute.  It's great in concept, but didn't work for us.  My daughter is now 2 years old, and whenever I get this toy out, it still does not capture her attention.",0
"I am also VERY disappointed in this case!!!  My son excitedly picked this out and I thought it would be PERFECT for him to keep all his supplies together and he would be able to carry it out to use any time.  Well, like everyone else has already said....the parts inside that hold all the crayons, pencils, etc, do not attach to the actual red case so every time we open and close the case everything falls out.  It's so frustrating to my son that he doesn't use it anymore or just trashes it.  SOooooooo mad that Crayola couldn't at least have attached the pieces together so they wouldn't fall out.",0
"When my 3.5 year old saw the box he immediately wanted to try it out and go fishing.  He first tried it without a battery installed and was able to manage it ok.  The fishing poles like to swing a lot when you move them, so he had to hold the rod at the midpoint just to keep it still enough to get it in the fish's mouth.  Now, once I installed the battery (1 C battery) and turned it on, the difficulty increased dramatically.  The game spins fairly fast and the fish don't have their mouths open for very long.  Trying to hook one on a swinging fishing pole can become a little frustrating, even for me.  Now I love a challenge, but if the playability of the game is more of a frustration than it is fun, then the game has lost its appeal.  The parts are cheaply made and I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't last very long.  Out of the box, a number of the fish's stickered eyes had either fallen off or were missing.It's a good game in that it helps to refine motor skills, but the application and construction of the game is a little too frustrating and disappointing to make it a worth while game.and he had to hold them still This game is a little frusThere are four plastic fishing poles that pivot and rock when you move it.  You lower the pole over the fishes mouth and wait for it to open, but the fishing poleTo clear up a few things: 1) The game uses 1 C battery, not 2 AAs. 2) There is no music as stated in the product description. 3) The fishing pole and fish are not magnetic as in other, smaller, wind-up versions of this game.My biggest complaints are that it spins a little too fast, which means that the fish don't keep their mouths open for very long. And because the fishing pole is two plastic pieces with a small cone/cup shaped plastic knob (which is only a little smaller than the fish's mouths) instead of a magnet on a string as in the small, wind-up versions, catching fish isn't all that easy. It's not terribly hard, as I got the hang of it in a few minutes, but it's definitely not as easy as in the magnetic versions.Lastly, the reason some people have trouble putting the game back into its box is because some of the fish are still in their &#34;up&#34; positions (sticking up, with their mouths open). You just need to rotate it manually until all fish are in their &#34;down&#34; positions. But be sure to only rotate it the way the thing normally rotates, though, otherwise you might damage it.",0
"I got these markers for my 18 month old. I know she is below the recommended age, but she loves to color and we just got a new house with white everywhere, so I thought I couldn't go wrong with these! I was wrong.The colors are very dull and not true to the lid color. Not at all as nice as the other crayola colors. It takes a few seconds for the color to appear after you color. This few seconds was too long for my daughter. Once the color showed up, she didn't make the connection between her coloring and the color that appeared 3 seconds later.I am an art professor and so is my husband, and I found it hard to stay in the lines while coloring because of the delay. This is pretty ironic and hysterical, but I could have paid the same amount of money on real art supplies with real results. All we got out of this gift was some huge laughs about how even professional artists couldn't operate these markers!Buy your kiddo some washable markers and regular paper instead.",0
"Aggravation is one of those eternal classics, and is also known as Wahoo (Parchisi is another variant of the same basic concept).  Unfortunately, this edition is not.  The board is cheaply made and rather hideous to look at (I guess that's all at the expense of ""being cool"").  This board has been out since the 1990s, and it's rather sad this is the only model currently available on the market that I know of.  The game goes much faster because of how wonky the marble path is around each home colour (purple, red, etc). The board itself is cheaply made and starts comes apart pretty easily.  Also, this board is aimed squarely at little kids, and Wahoo is one of those games that adults can play with equal pleasure.I have an Aggravation board from the 1980s, and that board looks so much more stylish.  I wish they had that.If you are wanting a good board, don't get this one.  There are plenty of home made wooden boards available on Ebay and other sources.  In the past few years I have bought two different wooden boards off Ebay that were dual sided.  One side had a four player version and the other side had a six player version for my wife's grandma who loves Wahoo.  I bought a second one from the same vendor a year or two later with an 8 player game on one side and a 4 player game on the second side.  The quality of these boards are great, strong, and durable.Trust me, if you like Wahoo/Aggravation, a wooden board is definitely the way to go!  Much classier and much more appealing to adults as well as kids!",0
"would have loved the item except that amazon shipped the item missing the handle, the seat belt, and the decals - therefore, we ended up having to ship the item back to amazon at a cost of almost as much as the item was worth!  So far we have not received a credit for the item OR the shipping so we are REALLY dissatisfied customers!",0
"As a parent and having played this game when I was a child and enjoying it very much then, I have to say that the way that Milton Bradley has modified their old fashioned games is pretty bad.  I remember the game when I was a child, the marbles were larger and the hippos as well, however playing the game was much more easier.  In this one we found a lot of incoveniences.Examples:  The marbles are very small and light, not suitable for children under 4, they often jump OFF the game board to the floor and if you have wood or tiled floor you'd have to run to get them.  The hippos would often detach from the main board while in game play, knowing children who are sometimes hyperactive this is a NO-NO.  My children who are only 5 & 6 (they were 4 & 5 last christmas) would be so excited playing the game when some of the mentioned things happened and could not keep up with marbles all over the floor.  In other words if a parent is not present the marbles will get lost under the surrounding furniture.  I just got tired of running after them.I also bought Operation also by Milton Bradley, don't even get me started there.  Quite a dissapointment as well.  With these modifications the fun of the games is gone.  The marbles from Hungry Hippos are nowhere to be found and the game is sitting there doing nothing, next step is the trash.",0
it looks cute and when one pulls it its eyes close and open. But the cord of the phone is too small. if the phone is placed on the table the receiver will not reach the child's ear until he holds the phone in his hands. It doesn't make any ringing sound or any hello or bye sound when u lift the receiver. Over all am not happy . But my son liked it however doest use it much,0
"My son received this as a birthday gift. I never played it as a child, and am not familiar with the original. But there are a couple of major things wrong with this toy. My main gripe is that - once it's installed - it will not fit back in the original box. That's a recipe for losing the 5 beanbags it comes with, and makes clean-up difficult. I'm tempted to just toss this thing across the garage, into the trashcan, but I'll probably end up donating it to my child's preschool to avoid putting another giant piece of plastic crap into the landfill.",0
"My daughter has been playing with the Fisher Price Grand Piano which is by far better than this piano. Fisher Price Grand Piano has the keys light up, has different modes for music, learning (numbers 1-8, colors, pitch, and rhythm), also you can play the piano by tapping the individual keys.This particular Rock and Roll Piano doesn't light up, plays different types of musical instruments, but the keys aren't as fun to play. My daughter played it a few times and went straight back to the Grand Piano. Consider buying that one instead.",0
"The picture is misleading.  This is just a case, no car at all.  It is really not worth that money.",0
"After buying this base set and 3 add-on expansions, I regret it. I heard it was one of the best in it's class and have always loved the Fantasy theme especially in board/card games, so I bought it.(Side note: I played the regular rules and then the Tom Vasel ""Epic Thunderstone"" rules as well.)I guess now after other complex card games have come out, it's easy to be down or negative on this historical game. For it was the 3rd game to come out in this genre as a ""deck-builder"" type game and still be different from classic, popular and all powerful Magic the Gathering card game.What is nice is that you don't have to take out a large loan to buy this game (like Magic). Instead it has a rather large amount of cards right in the box ready to be played. I do enjoy fantasy based games and video games so I was hoping this would fit my desires, but sadly this game falls incredibly flat.Quality: The cards have a nice raised textured pattern to them and fairly thick. The box is thick with a very nice insert to help you organize the cards. It all has a nice quality and will probably stand up over time. My only concern here is, much of the cards are surrounded by black ink and if you scratch or ""nick"" the cards, it is very visible (and doesn't look good).Art/Graphics: I have listened to other game reviews ""rave"" about the art, and until recent expansions of this game, I do not agree with the others. I do not like the art (especially the base set) and think it isn't up to the standards of the rest of the gaming world. Some cards they are down-right comical. Not to mention some of the art does not match and looks like another game entirely and very different styled artists were employed to create it.Price/Value: This game is very overpriced. For the amount of cards you get and the thickness of the box and it's nice insert, it's more worth $20-30, but not the asking price.Base mechanics: Basically deck building games imply that you are BUILDING your hand in order to be able to do actions on your turn (e.g. slay a monster or buy a good weapon). In many other games (such as the video game World of Warcraft or Skyrim) you can customize your character in order to be successful at your deeds. Collecting weapons and ""heroes"", only serve to give you attack points or buying points. For a hero really isn't a HERO in Thunderstone. This hero is just a number on a card with some art. You could have pasted a factory worker on the card trying to repair a broken down assembly line, because the theme and actions seem completely ""pasted on"".On your turn, you use 6 cards in your hand to do buying or attacking... that's it. If you don't have the right cards drawn on your turn, you may or may not do anything. However, simply to the point, the game ends up being is a ""gathering card"" game. As soon as you see your opponent killing monsters (and getting victory points in the process) it's a sprint for the finish line. It doesn't feel like a game, and at times the game felt like it was playing me. Thunderstone has very little strategy and much too much chance/luck involved. Thunderstone seems like an advanced version of Dominion which is a hugely boring game to me.To End: I should try and sell mine on Ebay where I'd get a great price for it. But I am probably going to keep it for those friends who want a think-less non-complicated game. Thunderstone is so flat and ""outright nothingness"" to it's core mechanics, that I am incredibly surprised this game is so popular. There is so many better games out there, that you would be better off with another one of them. For example, Lord of the Rings Living Card Game and/or Mage Knight are similar in theme and both are card games, yet they both have real consequences to what you do and real strategy that require you to think things through and make good decisions.In the end, ""to each his own"", and this game doesn't appeal to me or involve ""fun"". However, don't take my word for it, be very careful and watch some youtube videos on how it's played before you buy... you'll be glad you did the extra research.",0
"This potty has so many flaws.For one, the opening is just tiny.  My son ended up pooping all over the seat because of that.For boys the splash guard is a real problem.  If you don't have the splash guard on, of course he pees all out the front, but it flipped right down as my son sat down, so not only did he pee all out the front and on to the floor, he also peed on to the splash guard.It comes apart so easily, and it doesn't go back together all that well.And YIKES!  All the places the germs can collect!  There are so many little places for bacteria, both on the inside and outside of this potty.We gave ours away and got the Baby Bjorn potty instead, which is awesome!",0
"When these are in stock in game stores you can get this set for $5, apparently the fact that they are in between runs makes all the game shops feel like they should screw the customers.  $20 for this set is outlandish, at that price I would say just go ahead and flip for the additional $10 and get a whole other starter set.  That way you get the dice and an extra x-wing and two ties to go with it.  My suggestion is at this price, stay away and just play with the ones that came with it.  It is not ever necessary to have the extra dice they are only a convenience and at $20 not a very good one.  There will be another run of these here soon (late April-June) and all of you with out the patience to wait will be kicking your self for paying such a stupid price.  At the $5 price I would give this a 4 star rating because they are nice to have and make game play faster but at $20, no way.  It is time we all start teaching these stores that price gouge that it will not pay, by us as customers not giving in and paying their outrageous prices.  Just wait, they will be inexpensive again, just like the Millennium Falcon and the Tie interceptors will be.",0
"I give this game two stars because my 5 year old son always pulls it out to want to play with it. The game itself is not worth playing, but the construction part can be fun.However, the game pieces are so poorly and cheaply made that I don't think it is worth anyone's time to play with it. Not only do the parts NOT fit, but the thin plastic pieces bend and break very easily. My husband got this game because he played with it as a kid, but this particular set does NOT offer the same kind of fun as the old set.",0

"I had high hopes for this game, as I am a big fan of Fourth Edition D&D; (though if you like 3e, enjoy it! I'm not going to tell you one is better; I'll just tell you which one I prefer). I also enjoy games with modular tiles and such, so I really went into this game biased towards enjoying it.Sadly, all that couldn't rescue this game. It is exceedingly repetitive. Play about 3 turns and you'll get the entire experience this game has to offer - there will be nothing new or exciting for you. The game is hopelessly shallow, based on so much chance that strategy is non-existent. Despite the modular tiles, the game offers virtually no customization.The pieces seem to be well-made, and fortunately it might supply some use for actual D&D;, since the store I bought it from doesn't do returns. However, the quality of the pieces is not matched by the game itself.I really wanted to enjoy this game, so I played 5 whole games and an uncounted number of aborted attempts, before accepting the fact that it simply doesn't work. Extremely disappointing.",0

"I bought this for our son after seeing the commercial on TV & the glowing ratings here (to bad I didnt look at the bad ratings first). When it arrived the first dissapointment was to see the item was made in China - this promted my curiosity about the ""water"" in the toy, I went to the Fisher Price web site & found it unbelievable that they have NO WAY to contact them via e-mail! The next frustration was that of several others here that the straps were to short for our nice crib (newer convertible type). Being in a foul mood at this point I had my wife call their customer no service # to discuss the water & if they had longer straps (they dont have the straps - dont these people test their products in the real world? I think not). Their reply as to the safety of the water was that is was ""proprietary"" information & could not be disclosed! After many atempts to get info on this & talking to a ""supervisor"" same answer. We think this is totally uneceptable & will not be buying any Fisher Price products in the future (which we told them but they dont seem to care). I would have sent this thing back except I foolishly had trashed the packageing already.",0
"While the toy is &quot;Educational&quot; sings alphabet, and plays soft but catchy music not to annoying for parents, the base after time doesnt keep the ball secure.The ball is heavy, and will come apart after a fair amount of play.  When your child learns to THROW, you will want to hide this.  Its heavy and it hurts when it hits you.When the ball seperates as if you were changing batteries and it will, the plastic edges are a tad but sharp.I do not recommend this toy.",0
"A friend of mine has one of these and her kids love it!  So I ordered one and it has a very strong chemical odor that won't go away and it doesn't inflate all the way (the legs, tail and ears don't fill up completely).

I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction. He has only used it four or five times. He gets frustrated that his finger covers the answer and the plastic is so thick it is hard to read anyway. I remember using this toy when I was young and I thought the manufacturers would have developed a better product since materials have changed so much in the past twenty years.,0

"I thought my one year old would be super into this, he loves sticking things into slots. However he is barely interested in it. Partly because someone has to hold down the flimsy foam bottom while putting them in.

Then you still have to push fairly hard to put them on top of each other, though they still stand up somewhat if you don't click them in all the way. We are disappointed as there were many of these types of things to choose from and I am sure some of the others are better. And they are definitely overpriced.",0

"What a great idea!  A toy that babies can get creative with and not get messy!  If only it worked ...The surface is blue ""goop"" but enclosed in a strong plastic film so as you ""fingerpaint"" on the ""goop"" you aren't getting any on your fingers.  As the the ""goop"" is moved aside by your fingers bright colours are revealed behind to make your work of art even more colourful.  There are stampers as well to make shapes.  To clear the screen you simply move the bar up and down (like a Magna Doodle) and start over.  And to make it even more fun when you press down on the screen music plays.  There is a stand as well - making it easy for sitting babies to draw.Unfortunately the toy did not live up to our expectations.  You must press quite firmly on the ""goop"" screen to make an a good impression and to get the music to play.  My daughter was never able to press hard enough to make the music work. And when any sort of pressure was applied the stand would collapse.  The stampers just kind of make a blob in the ""goop""  and not a nice clear image as you would expect.  To clear the screen you must move the bar up and down at least 5 - 10 times to make a clear surface.  My daughter had no interest in it at all.This toy is disappointing and I wouldn't recommend it.  Try a Magna Doodle when your baby is a bit older - now that is a great creative toy that works!",0
"I love this toy, but I'm not sure about my 9 month old daughter.  She is still learning how to use it and is more interested in chewing on the pieces.  She does like to watch me dump the pieces out and put them back in.  I like it because it's nice and simple and does not require batteries.",0

"When I broke out Party Gras for the first time, it seemed like it could be a fun addition to a party.  Just as quickly, people didn't care about the game and it broke up the flow.The ""game"" is simple, you try to do tasks on cards and when you do, you get more Mardi Gras style beads.  Sadly, the game doesn't function as a game on its own and when combined with other games or a party, it simply becomes a hassle.  Essentially there will be one person really into it, going around collecting beads while ruining everyone else's attempt to enjoy the party.It is a fine idea in theory, but the reality of playing it is rather painful.",0

"Again, like Arkham Horror, I really looked forward to playing this game, and once again I was terribly disappointed.  If you like playing games where all you do is roll dice all night long trying to get a certain combination play D&D, if you want to do that a be really bored play this.  Literally, all you do in this game is roll dice trying to get some combination required on each card that gets progressively harder with each successful role in order to obtain a few objects on the card that really do nothing as far as helping you win the game other than the elder signs.  However, by the time you actually manage to collect any of these the monster will have already woke up so they will be of no use to you because then it will just come down to rolling dice to see if you can inflict enough damage to kill it before it kills you.  The only upside to this game is it was over in about 45 min. instead of the 5.5 hours its big brother Arkham Horror took.",0

I received the same crappy, flimsy, cheap new Trouble board game, where there is a piece of paper that goes over the plastic board peg holders.  When you push the number bubble, all the pieces come flying off the board because it is THAT FLIMSY.  So you are constantly fixing the pieces and trying to remember where you are in the game.

Taking it apart and putting it back together in different configurations (which should be half the fun) always proves fatal for at least one more piece of the set for us; they crack and spliter off sharp chards every time. While I love this idea and love wooden marble sets, I regret purchasing this and certainly don't recommend it as it is made of such flimsy plastic.",0

I had high hopes for this because my son LOVES to make parachute's out of bags (course the don't really work) and he loves the cheapy parachute men he got at a birthday party (but they tangled too easily).This doesn't tangle, and the idea/design is good, just need a little better man to go with it.",0
"I thought these were made of metal, they are a in fact made of a cheap plastic material which after some use I feel will easily break.",0
"my 2 yr old loved stamping with these, but when he was done we started to clean up and he had ink stains left all over his hands, he is not a big fan of dirty hands, so he was not pleased.",0
"When my niece was younger... about 10 years ago I bought her this toy, it was fun  and included lots of shapes.I recently purchased this now for my 6m old and to my surprise it only has 9 shapes!  Holy cost reduction!!I liked this toy for the storage of all the pcs, they just stay inside and usually wont fall out.The color is kind of blah now too...Look for other shape sorters that do the same thing but offer more pcs, you're going to need them as they get lost VERY easily!",0
"This toy was my first Fisher-Price purchase for my son and it was a complete waste of time and money!! The top of Roller Coaster kept coming off and the loop track came off very easily. (which my son had around his neck in a matter of seconds.) The ferris wheel and flying planes, grew tiresome after a few minutes. My son still plays with the smaller Fisher-Price sets, but the Fun Park was sent back to the store two days later!",0
"This card game has a few flaws. The cards do not fit in standard card protectors (have to use some obscure sized protectors) if you want to lengthen the life of the cards. The game play lacks much if you have played Dominion or any other similar style card game. I think if you have never played Dominion it might be a really fun game, but after having played dominion or any other similar game, this game just feels shallow. Game play becomes predictable quickly in small groups and is only made slightly better by adding more players. Replay value is low at best since there are no expansions or different occupations to mix in and out of the game. Save your money and learn a card game with more variety.",0
"The stones in the set were damaged and not as advertised. The description for &#34;Gemstone Playing Pieces&#34; is misleading. What I received was just cracked glass. The board is also of extremely poor quality and feels very rough and unfinished. To make matters worse, I ordered two of these.",0
"I bought this game for my five-year-old for Christmas because I enjoyed it as a child and because they were out of Moon Sand! The game comes in pieces -- the square base, the four hippo bodies and four hippo heads. When you put it together, it doesn't fit in the box. The instructions suggest taking the hippos off for storage. They have a picture of how to arrange it, but it doesn't fit in the box that way. You can tell on the picture the pieces are hanging over the edge. So you have to take at least one hippo head off to make it all fit. Putting it together isn't too much trouble but the pieces are evetually going to wear out and not snap together. I don't expect this toy to make it until next Christmas unless we find a place to store it out of the box.The game is really fun, parents will even enjoy playing it with the kids. Just don't expect it last forever.",0
This is what happens when a company decides that they can make much more money by re-making a very popular game as cheaply  as possible (made in china) and then charging more for it. I ordered the game that is pictured and was willing to pay the $20 price tag because my grandkids have one and love it. What I received from School Specialty was &#34;the new and improved&#34; cheaply made version that sells at Walmart for $6. Stay away from this Hasbro disaster.,0
"I'm bummed, I love the pool in the picture, and wanted it specifically to use as a ball pit for a party that is yellow and red themed (curious george)...I was sent this pool instead:Intex Kiddie Pool Summer SunsetThere is no mention in the description that the designs vary.Pool is same size and stuff and will work- buts its not what is in the photo the seller has up.",0
"Like some other reviewers mention, the Ker Plunk game here is an updated version of a classic game beloved by my parents and myself as children. My husband and I were eager to introduce this game to our 5-year-old and thought it would be a fun game to play with as a family. We did have fun, but the two adults (me and hubby) found the shoddy construction particularly deplorable.Basically, the game parts consist of two plastic tubes with a plastic connector in between. These three parts are to be manually attached together and stood on the game base which is also made of plastic. The plastic color sticks are then to be inserted through the little holes in the tube connector in a crisscross pattern which will serve to hold the marbles ( which are provided in the box).The problems with this game are mainly due to the cheap plastic parts - they are so insubstantial and moving the canister (for each player's turn) is cumbersome as a result and inadvertently jolts the marbles even further. Luckily, my 5-year-old was patient enough with the careful manipulation during each player's turn, and we did have fun, but we found the overall experience to be underwhelming.",0
"The product they are advertising, the older game with the 5x5 grid, is not what was shipped.  We received the 3x3 grid.  Now, I have to go through the hassle of returning this game.  Based on other people's reviews, this is not the first time this has happened and this is false advertising.  Essentially, you are selling the kiddie version at a 200% mark up with the hope that some people won't return the product. You need to be reported or pull this product.",0
"I purchased this particular model for a 10-yr. old boy who was within the suggested weight range.  It made a terrible noise of metal-on-metal rubbing and didn't seem to bounce back as freely as it should have.  I had puchased two different pogo sticks for other kids at the same time and they ran a lot more smoothly without the horrible noise.  I think the unit we got was probably defective, so we returned it to amazon.  It appears to be a well-constructed model for younger children.",0
"Yikes!  There's trivial, but then there's ridiculous.  If you're over 30, playing this game is laughable.  So obscure are some of the questions and answers -- that it's really more of a guessing game than one that tests your knowledge.  It's too bad, since previous editions are fun.  And sorry, I agree that the card dispenser can be a bit aggravating -- just give us the box to hold the cards in!!!  Why fix it if it ain't broken?",0
This toy is so expensive and yet so cheaply made.  They break easily and don't work well.  For these steep prices ($40) you can so much more for your money than this thing.,0
"I don't want anyone else to be as frustrated by this as we are, so I'm actually going to throw this in the garbage.The big problem can be summed up as:THE PEGS FALL OUT. Whenever you try to put pegs close to one another, you'll knock out any pegs in the nearby vicinity. The old Lite Brites were angled, which helped to keep the pegs in. This cube is straight, so gravity pulls the pegs right out. They're not designed properly to stay in.The model I have does not look like the one pictured with the slide-out drawers, so I'll skip giving it a hard time over that particular feature... but it looks identical in terms of the cube itself. And that's the problem. My 4-year-old couldn't do this at all, so I basically put the whole design together myself. And narrowly avoided cursing at least 8 times. I tried different techniques, like ""pre-holing"" the holes nearby when I was about to put pegs close together. It made very little difference. I had to keep redoing it over and over.If you can manage to get a whole design done, yes, it still looks cool like you remember from your youth. But getting there is no fun at all. I hope my daughter doesn't notice when I toss this thing out. Just so aggravating that it's not worth it.",0
"We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old for Christmas.  He played with it a few times the first couple of weeks but has not touched it since.It does not seem as sturdy as our other Fisher-Price toys, although it has not broken, probably because it is not getting any use.He really loves the FisherPrice figure-8, motorized track - although it got so-so reviews, ours has worked perfectly and he uses it all the time.",0
"My daughter wanted a pogo stick soooo bad for her 9 birthday, so I purchased this.  I think she has only played with it about 5 times in a year.  Not worth the money to me, but if you have a kid who loves these things, then I suppose it would be a good one to buy.  It's fairly solid and sturdy...certainly nothing wrong with it other than my kids lost interest in it quickly.",0
"I feel robbed. The hippos never stay on the base plate, unless you use your other hand to hold them down. Out of 4 hippos, 2 work great, and the other 2's levers stick nearly every time you try to grab a marble. It frustrates us to the max!!!",0
"My 3-year-old son desperately wanted this game, and while I wanted to get him something more educational (where you actually learned something) I gave in and we got this toy.  I wish I hadn't.  He played with it for about 20 minutes, and it's seen only the dust in the toybox ever since.  The teeth will stick down and not reset, there's really not much fun about this toy, unless you like getting your hand snapped between two 'gator lips!",0
"My daughter received this as a gift for her 1st birthday. She is now almost 16 months old and it has never really interested her. It's a cute toy - with the 3 removable frogs and the catchy songs and letter buttons to push, but it just doesn't interest her. She will fiddle with it for a couple of minutes and then move on to something else. I just don't think it really does enough or has enough to do on it to hold her attention. I have a son who is 2 & 1/2 and he has never really shown any interest in it either.",0
"Let me start out by saying I am a big fan of little people & had them as a child & have bought them for my child.  BUT I really dislike this toy!!  It looks like lots of fun but the cars won't loop the loop & stay on the track which is pretty much the whole idea of the toy.  The ferris wheel & swing are mildly entertaining but my daughter ignored the entire set until she realized that some (& only some) of her hot wheels cars will run the loop completely.  Fortunately, I didn't have to pay a dime for this toy as I got it free from a Pampers giveaway but unfortunately my belief in Little people has been tainted & I will be more careful when purchasing them.  I really thought their standards were higher but I guess this one slipped through their qc department!!!",0
This product is just so-so. Makes popping sound but that's about. Won't hold interest for long.Better spend a bit more for one of those poppers with funny heads going up and down when rolled over.A more interesting sight.,0
$28.99 The week before XMas ?!!! Crazy ! I found it for $13 (and not even in sale) at my local Target.I will update my review on the toy itself after XMas and when my son will have gotten some time to play with it.,0
"I didn't follow their recommendation that this isn't for kids under three, and I purchased this for my 18 month old daughter. She liked it, but quickly outgrew it. Plus it toppled over easily when she would bounce on it. Don't used it around any other furniture because they will fall off it several times. It's just not stable. I do not see how a 3 year old would ever fit on this. It's very overpriced in my opinion. I sold it at a yard sale for half what I paid for it after only 4 months.",0
"My Grandson got this and because of the movie, he got this one, but all my Great Grands got one cheaper and IMHO better because the arms and legs were wire and extremely posable. However, my Grandson (9 yrs old) loved this elf and his Momand Dad had fun using the concept during the Holidays.",0
"These paints are more soap than paint.  When your fingers are wet the paints slide right off them, so it's extremely difficult to a: get them on your fingers to begin with and b: apply them to any surface at all.  They have barely any pigment and don't stick to the side of the tub.  Don't waste your money.",0
"We purchased this marble run for our 4-year old son because of his great love for wooden marble run assembly blocks, which he has been using since he was 2. While this set ia  terrific idea and certainly has a lot of educational value, it is made of very flimsy plastic and is in no way durable. Taking it apart and putting it back together in different configurations (which should be half the fun) always proves fatal for at least one more piece of the set for us; they crack and spliter off sharp chards every time. While I love this idea and love wooden marble sets, I regret purchasing this and certainly don't recommend it as it is made of such flimsy plastic.",0
"This toy appears to be good quality and is easy to use and my little boy enjoyed it until it stopped working...within less then a year of occasional use.  Changing out the batteries did not prove to be helpful.  It simply ""gave up the ghost"" and was ready for the trash bin.  Very disappointing.",0
"This is a very attractive toy. The ocean sounds are so realistic you feel as if you were on the beach. That is my impression. My grandson (10 months) however has a different view.For the first day or so after the toy arrived he would pick the balls up and hold them in his hands while trying to get the little items inside to spin around. However, they would only spin once or twice and stop. He would push the bowl around and listen to the ocean sound for a bit but it was too heavy for him to get it to make the splashing sound. I had to jiggle the bowl in order for him to hear that. He never quite got the ""dropping the balls in the bowl"" part. He would drop them in and nothing, to him anyway, would happen so that ended pretty quick.He hasn't played with it since that first day or two after it arrived.I would not recommend this product unless you are looking for a nice item to put on your child's shelf.",0
"I loved this game as a child and wanted to buy it for my 3 year old son.  Great game, now made into a piece of PLASTIC GARBAGE!. The light weight marbles are terrible and the heads of my hippos don't even lift up most of the time.It's truly a shame they have to ruin these type of games with cheap materials.",0
"Some people get this game and some don't. I get it and still don't like it very much. It's just way too random to ever be able to plan or carry out any kind of strategy over multiple turns. Having too many rules down at once causes turns to take forever, as you will have to stand up over the table and scan every card on the table in order to make a decision. If you &#34;get&#34; the game then you will have fun for a few hours, then quickly get bored with the limited effect that skill and planning have on your chances of winning.",0
"I bought 4 of these and they are really easy to fly and a lot fun. The first problem you will discover is the extremely short flight time. The flight time is 5 to 10 minutes for a brand new copter. The second problem is it doesn't take very long to damage them to the point where repairs are needed. If you don't damage it then you will find out that the battery life dies of pretty quickly. You will find that after you have flown it for several days that the flight time is getting shorter and shorter.It is educational because you will can get a lot of experience in how to repair RC Helicopters with the S107G. This model is repairable and parts are readily available. It does take good dexterity, mechanical ability, and good eyesight or reading glasses. When the batteries go bad, which is frequently, you can unscrew the cowling, pull the battery, cut the wires, trim the wires that remain and cut and trim the wires on the replacement battery. Then you get to solder the wires together and insulate them with tape. Yes you got the idea, no plugable battery connections, just a PIA POS that you have to solder in place. It IS VERY educational.I recommend bypassing the education by getting one and sending it back after it breaks which is usually two weeks or less if you fly it every day. This is well within the return policy for Amazon. Hey you get what you pay for, and for less than $20, that is exactly what get. Don't get me wrong it is a lot of fun to fly and if you like to tinker it is a WHOLE lot more fun.",0
"I have a 2.5 yo who LOVES to paint. To keep the mess to a minimum we paint nearly every day in the bathtub. What I liked about these are the colors and the variety. And they are very, very washable. They instantly clean off skin and our (sucky) bathfitters tub better than the squeezable tube crayola paints which have no smell but require a LOT of scrubbing (especially the red) BUT the good ends there. These STINK! After using the squeeze ones, I was shocked how much and how strongly these smell.These smell like acrylic paints or a poorly ventilated nail salon. Even my husband (who has a masters in art so he knows paint) asked when he first smelled these if I'd made a mistake and given her HIS paints. And he had to come in the bathroom to take over for me because they smelled so strong they caused me to have an asthma attack!So since we use these in a confined space (bathroom) where we can't guarantee a great cross-breeze, we gave these away after the first time to a friend who does store window decorations. His response? Thanks, but, wow do those SMELL STRONG!I can't believe they are non-toxic! Or safe for a little one with little lungs to breathe in. Or have on their skin! Or mouth! They rinsed right down and we will not use these ever again. I cannot take the risk of another asthma attack.BTW my friend said they have no smell when dry.",0
"I just bought this toy today and I'm returning it tomorrow.  It is the cheapest-made toy I've ever encountered.  As soon as I took it out of the box, I could tell right away I would end up regretting this purchase.  The one I got came with a dust-buster, which is even worse than the vacuum. Yes, it makes a loud noise and the front lights up, but it scratches the wood floors and is difficult to push across carpet.  The front panel has already fallen off, and the panel in front of the ""filter"" won't stay on.  My son loves it, but for the money ($30!!), there has got to be a better made toy vacuum.  One last thing....they should NOT advertise that it really works.  I wasn't looking for a vacuum that sucks up dirt, but the box says it does, and it doesn't even come close.  Unfortunately, at the store, there weren't any other real-looking vacuums to choose from.  Does anyone know where I can get a good quality, fun vacuum??",0
This broke the first time we took it out for our child to play with.  Was very disappointed.  Would go with a plastic one over a metal one if you want kids to play with.,0
"1.  DOES NOT FLY OR PERFORM AS ADVERTISED.2.  YOUR CHILDREN WILL PROBABLY BE DISAPPOINTED AS MY SON IS3.

"This game is fun at first, but the gameplay is too simple to hold your interest for long, some cards (especially some of the newer cards in the expansions) are wayyy too powerful, and you will find yourself falling into a tedious rhythm of back-and-forth ganging up on whomever is currently in the lead. Do not, I repeat, do NOT buy any of the expansions until you're absolutely sure you're in love with this game and want to keep playing it for years. They don't add much to the game and will require that you carefully trim your deck down to something manageable, as having a huge stack of door and treasure cards means that you won't even go through the deck once during a single game (something which is part of the flavor when you only have the original deck).",0
"Rounded edges..difficult to set up trails and knock'em down...disappointed in this puchase.They r nice for the traditional game, but my kids nor I am interested.",0
Very disappointed in this product. Everything is very cheaply made and I would not trust putting any samples in these containers. Junk! Just buy the real thing,0
"My children loved this toy but the sides fell off within a week and paint chips off very easily. I did expect paint to come off since there is friction involved, but not within a few days after we just bought it. I did contact Melissa and Doug company and they said they would look into the quality of the product (sending a box so I can return it to them, along with others I bought that did the same). It may be a bad paint batch but I do think parents need to be aware that the sides fell off easily (they do snap back on, though you really need glue to keep it workable) and the paint coming off is not good for young children who might put it in their mouth.",0
"Purchasing this toy is simply throwing money away.  I am astounded at the amount of things breaking on this stable, and the companion truck/trailer set my daughter was given as a gift.  The concept and look is great, and the opportunities could have been endless for play if my daughter was not bringing pieces to me one by one from these sets.  She is 5 years old and gentle with her toys, but this toy simply can not handle being played with even as intended.  There are things we can fix, like the cupola or roof shifting/falling off, but it is also beyond repair where gate/door hinges break.  We were without receipts for this item or it would have gone back the first day when the breaking began.  We have had a much better experience the Schleich jeep and trailer purchased for her 3 year old sister, but have not found a similar sized stable.  Again, these Breyer accessories are a waste of money for use as a toy being so poorly constructed.",0

I am so mad. I ordered this game back in August when I started ordering my Christmas gifts. Yesterday I started wrapping the gifts and thought it was strange that there was black sharpie markings on all sides of the box. I opened it up and all 4 boats had sharpie scribbles on them. Really . . . REALLY! I am not rating the game; I can't imagine an Amazon Vendor sending out something that would appear on the shelves of a Salvation Army store!!!!!,0
"I played Citadels three times, two with the regular rules and once with the included expansion cards, and all three games with max (or close to max) players. I didn't like it very much any time I played it. The game always drags toward the end and feels too long by 15-30 minutes. The most frustrating part is the high probability of the other players targeting you every turn (regardless of which character you pick to play, which can change every turn, but is often easy to figure out who is going to be who). If you get targeted, you could lose your turn (assassin), gold (thief), districts (warlord) or special ability (witch), none of which is any fun. It makes some characters impossible to choose no matter how much you need their special ability, because you know the other players will target them (especially the witch from the expansion, who steals their special ability and gets to go first). I like competitive strategy games but Citadels was simply too cut-throat for me. The game's artwork and production values are excellent, except for the gold coins, which are really just unpunched butterscotch-colored buttons and look it. For me, the unpunched buttons were a real letdown after the realistic (if tiny) gold coins that came withRio Grande Games Dominion: Seaside. My preference for competitive card games suitable for the whole family would be forDominion, which you can customize to increase or decrease the number of attack cards (even down to zero if you prefer) and is never the same game twice. Citadels is always the same boring game, even though you get random district cards and can't always be the same character every turn.",0

"As cool as I thought this puzzle was, it isn't. The holes for the letters are very shallow, and they fall out if barely even bumped. And, the actual letters themselves aren't very defined, like the ""m"" and ""w"". Those two are tricky enough for a toddler, and this puzzle doesn't make it any easier. I would go for another puzzle.",0
"I have played hundreds of different games, and the game play for this one is one of the worst.  It has too few playing spaces on the board, it has paper bills but almost none are used, there is no excitement in playing, almost all luck in who wins so little thinking is involved, each timed played is about the same, no interaction (play) between players, and there does not seem that any leaning can be accomplished.  The quality is good, and the plastic coins can be used for something else.",0
"Hated this product.Predictable.  Not fun.  It attempts to be a fast setup table top game but feels as a meshed together mess of crap.  Often times I thought &#34;this seems like d&d; battle....  Just kidding&#34;.  We never played it again after one play through.Would not recommend this for an older gaming group that enjoys board/card ga,es like talisman and 7 wonders and ascension.F",0
This toy doesn't need a hammer at all. The pegs are so loose in the holes they push right through with a toddlers hands. I was hoping it was like the old fashioned Peg Bench where you actually hammered the pegs down and then flipped it over and hammered it again. This is useless.,0
"This ride on toy was given as a gift for my son's first birthday. My son would rather push this toy around than to sit on it and take it for a ride. He'd enjoy it if I were pushing him around but I'd have to teach him to keep his feet up or it'll hit the wheels. After minutes of pushing and my backaches, the fun is done and he just wanders off and looks for something else to play with. Also, this toy is very lightweight so when he tries to get on or off this bike without assistance,it'll tip or slide, making him lose his balance and fall. There are other toys out there that would be more exciting and less painful.",0

"We got this as a gift recently. At first glance it sounded like a good idea, until I read the story.1. The elf ""watches"" your kids and then tattletales on them to Santa. Really? We teach our children not to tattletale. I don't like the idea of anything, real or imaginary being a dedicated tattletale.2. Religion. The elf makes sure you do your prayers. This is a non starter, we are not a religious family, so this book is basically written for Christians, but that seems to be the theme for the whole book.3. Santa is a bad enough idea (he is not ""real"" in our family, just a mythical figure for fun, like Frosty). But this elf is a tangible object and he is supposed to fly back to Santa every night and tattletale on your kids. This is insulting my myself and my kids.This story is basically just a reinforcement of the Santa mythos, ""do good or else you get no toys"". I teach my kids to do good for good sake and the golden rule. I don't want them to think they have to pretend to be good just for a reward or because some magic person is watching them. 'Be careful the elf, Santa or god(s) are watching you!'is a horrible thing to teach kids.The best fun we had with the elf was the fact that is is freaky looking and my four year old is scared to death of it in a Chucky sort of way. So we beat it up and play fetch with it with the dog just to make her laugh and not to fear it. After the holiday season I think I will just toss the elf in the garbage and donate the book.So in short, want to instill fear into your children, buy this product. Otherwise respect their intelligence and invent something new - not just the repackaged Santa story. I'm sure the inventors have made millions on this crap, don't add to it.",0
Arrived with a botched paint job - sent back and didn't use. I've liked all of the HABA items we have purchased other than this so it was disappointing.,0
"I thought this product looked good on the website.  I own the set that only has capital letters and it was fine.  But I was very disappointed with this particular set.  The letters are all cut unevenly, and I got splinters from handling this almost immediately.  I had to scrape off the wooden splinters from each of the letters before letting the kids play with them.As far as play goes, it works better as a teaching tool when it is unopened.  Once you take the letters out, the board looks very busy as there is a lot of illustration underneath each letter.  It is difficult to see the slots where the letters are supposed to go, and my 2 year olds lost interest in it fairly quickly as a result.  I am considering outlining every letter with a sharpie or something so they can see where the slots are.The letters are also kind of poorly cut.  For example it is hard to tell a ""u"" from an ""n"", and a ""d"" from a ""p"".  The ""i"" and ""l"" also look too similar.  It's just not a good set for teaching purposes.As it would take too much trouble to return this, I might end up buying the Hape - Lowercase Alphabet Stand Up Puzzle.  I don't think it matters much though, they will learn the letters eventually and don't need any particular tools to get to that point.  This was just a splurge item.",0
"I thought there would be dashed lines or something to show where to add stuff in the book, but basically it's just a picture book that you could stick stuff to. In addition, it didn't come with very many stix.",0
"Melissa and Doug's Deluxe Wooden Pound-a-Peg is a classic toy; however, this particular item does not live up to Melissa and Doug's reputedly high standards.  While the finish on the hardwood is smooth and even, the pegs fit extremely loosely into the bench portion of the toy.Thus, while this toy was a bit of fun for my seven month old grandson, by the time he reached ten months of age he was no longer interested in hammering.  He was able to push the pegs down with little effort and so was not keen on using the pound-a-peg as intended.  Instead, he found he could easily remove the pegs which could then be used as chew toys.  Further, he took to laying them on the play area of the family room; the flooring was a bear-themed rug in primary colors and the pegs were nearly undetectable.  If the adults in the family were not careful, they risked a slip-and-fall.  Additionally, because the pegs were attractive as chewing toys and carried in his mouth, I was concerned that if my grandson fell while holding one by the end, he might ""impale"" himself on the peg.Because this toy is reasonably well made, I gave it two stars instead of one.  However, the limited time period in which this toy holds a child's interest, as were the possible safety concerns, resulted in my decision not to award it any higher a rating.  This toy was definitely not up to Melissa and Doug's reputedly high standards.",0
"I had a Lite-Brite as a kid and loved it, so I was enthused to pick this up for my kids (4 and 6).  What a disappointment.The only thing positive I'll say about it is that the 4-sided configuration, allowing more than one kid to play at once,  is actually a very good idea  Everything else about this Lite-Brite Cube is absolutely idiotic in terms of design for play value.- The pegs fall out- The pattern sheets, held only by pegs, fall off- The letters on the patterns that tell you what color peg to use are too small to be seen by small kids- The trays are too shallow and the pegs spill out- The tray have no covers for storage (in the version I have)- The frame is made of translucent white plastic that lets too much light through- The device has no on/off switch, meaning you have to plug/unplug it for play- The top is held with screws, making the bulb harder to tighten when the kids inevitably jiggle it looseThe thing that really burns me is that every point above could have been rectified very easily with just a little re-engineering.  Flange the pegs slightly; angle the faces a few degrees; add clamps for the patterns; ;use a bolder font; use opaque plastic in the case; add a toggle switch to the chord; attach the top with latches instead of screws.  A few simple modifications that any thinking person can come up with would make this an exponentially better toy without adding much to the cost of manufacture.But no.  The maker opted for the absolute cheapest properties and you get stuck with something more likely to frustrate than amuse your kids.  Drives me bats.  Cheaply made, poorly thought out.  Doesn't have to be that way.Don't know about you, but I'd gladly pay upwards of $25 for a toy like this that my kids would actually use.  Instead, I paid ten bucks for a useless hunk of plastic.  Sound like a bargain?-- mm",0
"This game did not hold my child's attention at all.  In short, the game has a trail-like path winding around a mound of earth.  Along the trail are several trap door-like spaces.  When a card is drawn, it directs the child to activate the mound, which in turn causes one of the trap doors to fall open.  If your figure is on the door and it opens, you lose.Unfortunately, the game is way too simplistic, even for a young child.  After about 5 minutes of play, my child was over it.  Cute concept, but it needs a lot more functionality/features to be interesting.",0
I bought this for my 10 month old.  He walks very well on his own already. He was excited when he heard the popping noise as I pushed it around and showed him how it works but for some reason he can't maneuver this toy by himself very well.  Even at 11 months he's not able to do it although he walks perfectly on his own. I think it's because the handle is so narrow and the toy is light weight.  Also on hardwood floors the wheels don't grip so it doesn't pop but rather just drags across the floor.  I would take this back to the store if i could.,0
"My son enjoys this, but it won't hold air for long.  The plug does not fit well and allows the ball to deflate quickly.  Pretty serious design flaw in my opinion.",0

"We purchased this game for our  granddaughter because our kids had it as children and spent hours of giggly fun operating on Sam. We were so very disappointed with the quality of the game. It sure isn't what it used to be. The plastic ""organs"" and ""bones"" slip right off the tweezers when you try to remove them during the ""surgery"". They could have at least produced some kind of grip edge on them. Also, the tweezers actually throw sparks when they touch the sides of the ""operative sites"". Coupled with the loud buzz, our granddaughter perceived the was going to be shocked or hurt. Even though we explained that she wouldn't be. She said, ""I don't like this game."" The game board itself is also very cheaply constructed. It's really a shame that they've ruined a game that was loads of fun in cutting costs by cheap manufacturing. Sadly, this is another product manufactured outside the USA and it's become junk!",0
"We have had nothing but trouble with this thing. Like other reviewers said the part that lifts up to empty the potty is not convenient. The latches on back to keep it together are very flimsy. The step stool only works when you take the potty apart and turn it upside down. The only time its convenient is if you are ready to move the seat to the adult toilet and use the step stool part as a step stool full time. But the worst part of this thing is the splash guard. My son never played with it. But once it was moved to the big toilet it would often come off and fall into the large toilet all on its own as my son was trying to get down. One day it fell off while I was taking him off the potty and I flushed before I realized it was in there. No, I didn't expect the chair to potty train my child for me but I certainly expected something that wouldn't fall apart.",0
"1.  DOES NOT FLY OR PERFORM AS ADVERTISED.2.  YOUR CHILDREN WILL PROBABLY BE DISAPPOINTED AS MY SON IS3.

"I had high hopes for this game, as I am a big fan of Fourth Edition D&D; (though if you like 3e, enjoy it! I'm not going to tell you one is better; I'll just tell you which one I prefer). I also enjoy games with modular tiles and such, so I really went into this game biased towards enjoying it.Sadly, all that couldn't rescue this game. It is exceedingly repetitive. Play about 3 turns and you'll get the entire experience this game has to offer - there will be nothing new or exciting for you. The game is hopelessly shallow, based on so much chance that strategy is non-existent. Despite the modular tiles, the game offers virtually no customization.The pieces seem to be well-made, and fortunately it might supply some use for actual D&D;, since the store I bought it from doesn't do returns. However, the quality of the pieces is not matched by the game itself.I really wanted to enjoy this game, so I played 5 whole games and an uncounted number of aborted attempts, before accepting the fact that it simply doesn't work. Extremely disappointing.",0
My four-year-old loves playing Go Fish over and over since getting these cards.Unfortunately the cards are pretty thin and she bends them very easily.Plus the cards in the Crazy Eights pack are all directions - there are no actual game cards in the pack so we can't play that one at all.,0
"The stones in the set were damaged and not as advertised. The description for &#34;Gemstone Playing Pieces&#34; is misleading. What I received was just cracked glass. The board is also of extremely poor quality and feels very rough and unfinished. To make matters worse, I ordered two of these.",0
"These come all stuck together in a grid, so after you pull them apart they have sharp bumps along the edges.",0
"This lite-Brite is a piece of junk! Don't wast your money! Maybe if I weren't comparing it to the older one I would think it was ok but even then I am not sure. I loved my lite-brite as a kid and wanted to get my daughter one so she could have as much fun as I did with mine.This has not left the box since the first day. First all of the screens where you stick the pegs are white not black like the old one so without the refill sheets it is useless.Also without the refill sheets the pegs are too big and they do not stay in.This was very frustrating! Even with the sheets sometimes they still fall out! I am really unhappy with this purchase and I can usually find something about a toy I like but not this one. I just didn't want anyone to be deceived into thinking that the screens were black and you could  make your own ""art"".",0
"In looking for fun games to play with our daughter, Cootie was one of those that we snatched up.  Remembering playing it as a kid brings back nostalgic memories and so you just assume that it's going to live up to those memories.  Sadly, Cootie does not.  First off, the game can drag on and become ridiculously monotonous once you've attained all body parts except for those six legs.  Rolling sixes can become rare and kids especially can become impatient and bored.  Then you have the pesky problem of poor craftsmanship which leads to body parts being difficult to attach (the legs in particular have a hard time going in their intended slots all the way) or that have a hard time staying attached (the heads fall off with the slightest movement).  My daughter had more fun playing with the individual Cooties than actually playing the game, and she would have had more fun had their heads stayed on while she played with them.  Alas, she played this yesterday and she's already over it.So am I.",0

"I'm giving this only 1 star more because of the seller than the game. It was shown in the photo as the 25 piece Milton Bradley game and the description read &#34;Fit all 25 pieces...&#34;. It was listed as Prime eligible and I selected 2 day shipping. It took more than a week to arrive and Instead of the Milton Bradley version, I was sent the Hasbro 9 piece game.  I bought the game on Amazon but they were not the seller. I have to give props to Amazon, though. I sent the game back the same day it arrived and by the next day Amazon had refunded my money.",0
"My family (sister, mom, husband + me) and I love Phase 10. We're avid card players and do well with complex games.

"As noted in my other relevant game reviews, I'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance.  She is what some would call a ""reluctant gamer"" whereas I am an avid gamer, so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to.  She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck (i.e., not all strategy) and aren't too complex (i.e., where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two), whereas I love strategy and complexity but don't mind a little luck. We also like games you can finish in a single session (or games you can play multiple times in a single session) This game fit the bill perfectly.Based on what I've read about this game on Amazon and BoardGameGeek this one seemed like a real contender.  And, there were many things we liked about this game.  We liked the theme -- you really feel like you are going on a journey (and that you got to play familiar characters and see lots of familiar faces and places along the way), the fact that it is cooperative, and the fact that we hadn't played anything quite like it before. And, I know lots of other people enjoy the game, and I by no means mean any disrespect to them by giving it a two star rating.But, after playing it twice with her (and a third time with two gamer friends), we all felt the exact same way... it just didn't feel very enjoyable to us. Most of the game play was good but not great (probably 3.5 stars), but the ending was main problem. After all your hard work (and assuming you are lucky enough to get to the end in the first place), whether you win or lose often comes down to a simple dice roll. This was very anticlimactic. No game should end that way.Given that there are also ways to lose along the way (in fact, it is quite possible you'll never get to the end... which was not a big problem as seeing how far you get each time can be a worthwhile challenge in and of itself), it seemed to us that if you get to the end something besides a random dice roll should determine the outcome of the game. At best (if things went very well along the way), you may get to make multiple dice rolls which can increase your chances of winning. But, ultimately a dice roll will decide your fate.",0
"This classic toy is overpriced here.  You can get it at any dept. store.Also this toy is not the best.  I have more trouble locating all the rings,that the baby throws them around everywhere.  Not the greatest toy.",0
"This would be a great game if it weren't made out of flimsy plastic. It is a pain in the neck to assemble and it constantly falls apart. The little flip-up doors don't stay hinged properly and if you don't get the little pictures inserted just-so, they fall out also. We've played it 3 times and I'm ready to throw it away. Shame on Milton Bradley for selling such a poor quality game.",0
"A friend of mine has one of these and her kids love it!  So I ordered one and it has a very strong chemical odor that won't go away and it doesn't inflate all the way (the legs, tail and ears don't fill up completely). The company and Amazon have great customer service but the product is flawed.",0
"So, you want to buy Scrabble, huh?  You were playing at your Grandmas, and you saw she had this cool version with a rotating turntable, wooden tile holders, nice deep pockets where the letters sit on the board.  You decided to buy one yourself here at amazon. You ordered it, excited to have a high quality Scrabble in your own possession. You get it in the mail, you open the box, thrilled to own Scrabble, but then.... the unthinkable!!  This ain't your Grandma's Scrabble!!  What they have done, is turn a nice idea into the cheapest thing they could come up with and still call it ""deluxe Scrabble"". PLASTIC. Everything is PLASTIC.  The tiles might be wood, I dunno I didn't bite them, but everything else is cheap, thin plastic.  Doesn't turn nice like the old version. And the biggest kicker of them all, is the board itself. Gone are the nice deep squares the tiles would sit in - where even if you bumped into the game or table, they would stay put.  Now it's shallow grooves, and you have to be careful not to turn the board to quicky or they'll move easy.You're better off buying an old one at a garage sale.",0
"So my boyfriend and I are pretty snobby about our games. And Gloom didn't really pass muster despite good recs. We played with 4 people (but we played will the full families, which was a mistake) and our game just kept going on forever. The instructions are not very clear. The fact that all your strategy can be wiped away with a single blow of a single card from someone else is annoying.We felt like we were missing a good deal of cards, though when we realized the instructions suggested that with 4 players you should have 4 total family members, that alleviated some of our icky feeling about the game. This is something where it feels like the expansion packs are really necessary to give the game that extra emphasis and enjoyability, which feels deceptive.Other thing: the &#34;storytelling&#34; is quite irrelevant to the actual mechanics of the game; you get no points for the quality of your story and while you are technically encouraged to integrate your family members' stories with those of the other players' families, it has zero effect on the game.There is actually disincentive to be interesting, because the shorter your turn and the quieter you are about your character, the less the other players notice how many points you are racking up on your character.Basically we wished we ended our gaming party with CAH and not gotten out Gloom, because it made all of us quite Gloomy.",0
"The board is in horrible condition.  I ordered it in February and kept it in my towel pantry closet, which is dry.  Didn't open it until today, in June because the kids were restless.  I almost cut my finger on the board taking it out of the box,  the thin top layers have separated and split from the thicker wood on top and bottom.  Very disappointed in the quality of this game board.  Now I have to glue the board together. Oh what fun!",0
"To many rules to much crap to keep track of, not for children at all.  Children just give up and walk off.",0
I am so mad. I ordered this game back in August when I started ordering my Christmas gifts. Yesterday I started wrapping the gifts and thought it was strange that there was black sharpie markings on all sides of the box. I opened it up and all 4 boats had sharpie scribbles on them. Really . . . REALLY! I am not rating the game; I can't imagine an Amazon Vendor sending out something that would appear on the shelves of a Salvation Army store!!!!!,0
"Ordered 2 of these for my kids systems- first, I THOUGHT they were chargers, which they are not. They are just power sources.  Guess thats my fault for not paying better attention.  But secondly, they barely lasted a month before they just quit powering the systems altogether.  Very disappointed.  So we are stuck just using batteries which the systems eat for breakfast. Purchase these at your own risk. Maybe you'll end up having better luck.",0
I wish this game had more pieces. I bought it for my 3 year old son at Christmas and there aren't very many pairs of puzzles. My son didn't even have to look very hard to find matches. The game doesn't last us very long playing. He doesn't learn anything from it which is a little disappointing.,0
"Recalling how I was mesmerized by my Slinky ""walking"" down our stairs as a child in the 1960's, I was really looking forward to introducing my 5 year old grandson to this classic toy.  (I purchased a ""Slinky Jr."" at the retail level, which was a complete waste of money... I promised my grandson I'd purchase a ""REAL"" Slinky, like Grandma had when she was his age.)  Finding the price seemed reasonable on Amazon, I purchased one, just received it this week, and went to give it an initial nostalgic ""workout"" prior to sharing what I remembered as a wonderful toy with him.  Well, it does NOT walk down stairs, and only does the initial ""flip"" when on the floor!  Maybe it was only $5, but I don't believe in throwing money out of the window!  What a shame that they - somehow - changed this product so that it no longer performs like the REAL ""original""!  So disappointed was I in this purchase that I wanted to try to figure out what ""happened"" to that great old Slinky.  Even though, as the box claims, it WAS invented in 1946, the inventor died in 1974, and his wife sold it to ""Poof Products"", the current manufacturer, in 1998.  I don't think the inventor would be too pleased with how they've changed his product over the past few years!  I didn't bother reading reviews prior to purchasing, because of the ""original"" label, but now that I've read over the first few pages of these reviews, I noticed something --- the 4 & 5 star ratings for the product are dated 2008 & prior (except for one reviewer who used them to keep out squirrels instead of as a toy)... the reviews from 2011, 2012 & 2013 are all rated only 1 or 2 stars, so they DID change something, and this is NOT the ""original"" Slinky!

"Bought this for my 13 month old as she has started cruising. Turn out the walker is so light, she could not hold on to it and walk without falling forward. She would play it for less than 5 minutes and not take a second look at it for the rest of the day.Overall, I would not recommend this for toddlers learning to walk.",0
"Some people get this game and some don't. I get it and still don't like it very much. It's just way too random to ever be able to plan or carry out any kind of strategy over multiple turns. Having too many rules down at once causes turns to take forever, as you will have to stand up over the table and scan every card on the table in order to make a decision. If you &#34;get&#34; the game then you will have fun for a few hours, then quickly get bored with the limited effect that skill and planning have on your chances of winning.",0
"I bought this toy for my 9 month old daughter. Convinced she would love it. I have tried for almost a month now to get her interested in this toy to no avail. Other than chewing on the ice cubes & pail she could care less about it. For that I could have just bought her plastic blocks to chew on that are far cheaper. Also, now that she is crawling she tried to pull herself up on it and it is so weightless it toppels over. I disagree with the manufacturer recommended age. This would probably be a much better toy for a 2-3 year old child that understands the kitchen and pretend play.",0
Overall very cute. Daddy stepped on it a few days later and the entire thing broke. Guess the kids will learn to pick up their toys now..,0
"Based on the fantastic reviews of this product I thought it was going to be a great hit. Wrong... the twins are terrified of this toy. They would literally startle/jump when they hear the popping noise. They have so far refused to have anything to do with it. They aren't typically timid or noise sensitive in most situations. The popping sound is very loud and sudden, so I can see how it can be anxiety provoking for a 1 year old unless it is used in a place with high background noise.  Luckily it is a cheap item so I will hold on to it in hopes that it will make a good gift for another child some day.  I will probably try to reintroduce this toy again in a few months, but seriously...  The only thing they are more frightened of is the vacuum cleaner.",0

"I was so excited to get this game, thanks to raving reviews here on Amazon and on another website.

"Kind of disappointed in this item. We didn't receive red, yellow or blue as described. We received purple which is annoying but doesn't affect the product. And there are only 10 monkeys.

"This toy was my first Fisher-Price purchase for my son and it was a complete waste of time and money!! The top of Roller Coaster kept coming off and the loop track came off very easily.

My son still plays with the smaller Fisher-Price sets, but the Fun Park was sent back to the store two days later!",0

There is no hands on interaction except controlling the loader to go forward or backward. I don't think it is a good, stimulating toy for my son!!!",0
"The organs and bones snap in to hold them in place, problem is it doesn't stay. its such a tight fit, one part snaps in causing a chain reaction of other parts popping out.

Its also much smaller than I thought it would be.  We returned it.",0
"I have 4 kids, 6 yr old, 4 yr old twins and an infant. I wanted something that the older 3 could play together, and something simple and fast. This was definitely something they could have fun with but they cannot play with it without an adult. The plastic pieces of the main body don't fit tight together so if you knock it around, it wobbles and could fall apart. The sticks are flimsy/bendy. When you stick it through the wholes, they bend depending on which hole you put it in (if not aligned properly). And then when there are a lot of sticks already, putting the last few sticks in is a little tougher. Sometimes some of the sticks just fall out so I sort of have to ""stitch"" other sticks in to make sure it's over and under the others so it doesn't just fall out on it's own.There is a little basin on the bottom for each player. So the tube body part rotates so that when the marbles fall, it falls on that player's basin. But the frustrating thing is, the whole tube body is wobbly. Just by rotating it, the balls could fall through and mess up the game. So this job isn't for little hands. I have to sit with the kids and rotate it for each player.The other frustrating thing is there is no way to store the game without the marbles and sticks falling out. The box it came in is not a hard one so it's destroyed once opened. Then the pieces don't just stack properly in order to just put the marbles and sticks together. There's just no way easy way of storing it so the pieces don't get lost.",0
"This toy has been through both of my kids now and I've had the same experience with both: this toy is just fine as a ""riding/scooting"" toy but is terrible as a ""learn to walk"" toy.  The problem is there is very little to no resistance in the wheels so as soon as you begin to push on the handle, it goes rolling.  This is useless for a child that still needs some help balancing as he/she begins to learn how to walk since as soon as the kid puts any weight on it, it shoots forward.  This is probably a larger problem on my hardwood floors but I can't see it being significantly better on carpet.The good side of the toy is that it is well sized for a riding toy.  The handle is place well and my kids were/are able to get on and off easily by themselves.",0
"Aggravation is one of those eternal classics, and is also known as Wahoo (Parchisi is another variant of the same basic concept).  Unfortunately, this edition is not.  The board is cheaply made and rather hideous to look at (I guess that's all at the expense of ""being cool"").  This board has been out since the 1990s, and it's rather sad this is the only model currently available on the market that I know of.  The game goes much faster because of how wonky the marble path is around each home colour (purple, red, etc). The board itself is cheaply made and starts comes apart pretty easily.  Also, this board is aimed squarely at little kids, and Wahoo is one of those games that adults can play with equal pleasure.I have an Aggravation board from the 1980s, and that board looks so much more stylish.  I wish they had that.If you are wanting a good board, don't get this one.  There are plenty of home made wooden boards available on Ebay and other sources.  In the past few years I have bought two different wooden boards off Ebay that were dual sided.  One side had a four player version and the other side had a six player version for my wife's grandma who loves Wahoo.  I bought a second one from the same vendor a year or two later with an 8 player game on one side and a 4 player game on the second side.  The quality of these boards are great, strong, and durable.Trust me, if you like Wahoo/Aggravation, a wooden board is definitely the way to go!  Much classier and much more appealing to adults as well as kids!",0
"I bought this as a fun game for me and my son to play. Boy was I wrong!! It's nothing but frustration for us both!!! The pieces DO NOT stick in the bugs and fall off easily. The legs are also horrible to put on!!! The rules of the game are ok but the pieces are absolutely horribly made. I would not buy this again.Also, this isn't the first one we got that did this. My mom brought one home from her work (she's a teacher) and it didn't work either. So it isn't just our version.",0
"I saw a demo of this at a local toy store sometime after my kids pointed this out the TV commercial. It looked even worse than the commercial and there are too many moving parts for this to work reliably. From my vantage point, even the commercial seems to barely show the thing working...If you want good Hot Wheels toys, you should stick with the basic building sets (like the Hot Wheels Starter Kit) as they don't employ all of the special effects gizmos that cause the toys to be too hard to use.",0

"My mom bought this toy foor my son for Christmas last year (2010).  My son is just about 2 1/2 now.  I wanted a jack in the box so that my son could work on his motor skills and oppositional skills.  He loves being surprised too.  For the 11 months that we have owned this toy my son still can't crank the handel.  I myself find it kind of awkward to do so.  The toy is cute and hasn't broken (yet).  The star on the front turns and clicks.  My 4 month old loves when I turn it.  The button for the squeaker on the back is kind of hard to push (for me).  My two year old hasn't tried playing with the button because it's so hard to push (he has other toys that squeak when you push them and he can do it just well).So, in conclusion, because the toy is so awkward and hard (for a child) to manipulate our toy has been not much more than space taking up my kids' toy box.",0

Its also much smaller than I thought it would be.  We returned it.",0
"We've had the game for almost a year and we've only played it when it arrived.  Frankly, my 5 year old daughter and I didn't find it as much fun or as stimulating as expected based on the positive reviews.  Main complaint is that the pieces are INCREDIBLY flimsy (has a home made feel) and one has to manage that aspect instead of fully focusing on the important things.  My secondary complaint is that the game is barely more involved than the basic memory card games that cost much less and no where near as challenging as Zoombinis software, which we love.  So, this game is not much fun, not well made, not very stimulating, yet it carries a relatively high price - avoid it!",0
"My 12 month old daughter received this for her birthday.  I was initally thrilled with the welcomed new classical tunes (all of which are very pleasant to listen to).  The toy has two modes, one that plays the whole song(s) and one that plays part of it and stops until the baby moves the toy again to get it going.  THis mode also will make sounds if the toy is not jiggled within a minute or so.  Sadly, I was disapointed in this toy because it doesn't automatically shut off which I thought was very silly.  Thus the toy will remind you that it's still on FOREVER!!  So it doesn't make a nice crib toy becasue she can't turn it on or off by herself (you have to flip a hidden switch to get it on and off)and will play all night if you let it. Finally, my daughter wasn't particularly interested in the toy anyway.  Thus I had to give low stars on fun & education since she wasn't drawn to it to play or learn, though the music IS very nice. As for durability, the thing is like new since she doesn't touch it.  Didn't do it for us.",0
My four-year-old loves playing Go Fish over and over since getting these cards.Unfortunately the cards are pretty thin and she bends them very easily.Plus the cards in the Crazy Eights pack are all directions - there are no actual game cards in the pack so we can't play that one at all.,0
I think this is OK.  It looks like more fun then it actually is.  my kids get excited to use it and then after about 30 seconds they have moved on.  It is not easy to stay on and bounce.  i have a daycare and over think it is a waste of money.,0
"NES is the best ever, SNES was great but N64 for me had no games that were nearly as memorible.  I enjoyed Doom 64, WCW/NWO games, MK Trilogy, Goldeneye, Banjo Kazooie and thats about it but again nothing really memorible.  The grapics were new at the time but look like total garbage now and I have no desire to play the N64 but I still play NES to this day.",0
"As a parent and having played this game when I was a child and enjoying it very much then, I have to say that the way that Milton Bradley has modified their old fashioned games is pretty bad.  I remember the game when I was a child, the marbles were larger and the hippos as well, however playing the game was much more easier.  In this one we found a lot of incoveniences.Examples:  The marbles are very small and light, not suitable for children under 4, they often jump OFF the game board to the floor and if you have wood or tiled floor you'd have to run to get them.  The hippos would often detach from the main board while in game play, knowing children who are sometimes hyperactive this is a NO-NO.  My children who are only 5 & 6 (they were 4 & 5 last christmas) would be so excited playing the game when some of the mentioned things happened and could not keep up with marbles all over the floor.  In other words if a parent is not present the marbles will get lost under the surrounding furniture.  I just got tired of running after them.I also bought Operation also by Milton Bradley, don't even get me started there.  Quite a dissapointment as well.  With these modifications the fun of the games is gone.  The marbles from Hungry Hippos are nowhere to be found and the game is sitting there doing nothing, next step is the trash.",0
"The pool came with leaks, and doesn't stay inflated for more than an hour. I followed the directions perfectly to avoid damaging it in the setup. It's not worth it to have a pool if you have to constantly refill the air (especially considering the fact that the ring with the leak can't have any water pressure on it while blowing it up).",0
"After blowing it up, it was smaller than expected.  It also was coated in some oil or grease.  Very gross!  Definitely would not buy again.",0
"Again, like Arkham Horror, I really looked forward to playing this game, and once again I was terribly disappointed.  If you like playing games where all you do is roll dice all night long trying to get a certain combination play D&D, if you want to do that a be really bored play this.  Literally, all you do in this game is roll dice trying to get some combination required on each card that gets progressively harder with each successful role in order to obtain a few objects on the card that really do nothing as far as helping you win the game other than the elder signs.  However, by the time you actually manage to collect any of these the monster will have already woke up so they will be of no use to you because then it will just come down to rolling dice to see if you can inflict enough damage to kill it before it kills you.  The only upside to this game is it was over in about 45 min. instead of the 5.5 hours its big brother Arkham Horror took.",0
"DVD games are a real mixed bunch. Sometimes they are good, sometimes they are bad. But when they are bad, they tend to be horrible. My kids really enjoy the little mini-games the come as extras on some movie DVDs, so I thought I would give this game a shot. While it is not the worst game I've ever played, it ranks pretty close.The pacing of this game is just too slow. I got bored, my kids got bored, and in the end we just pushed on to say that we finished. I don't think we even got excited about a winner. Don't get me wrong, I think that if the family sat down to do this as a Christmas chat type activity, it would be better. We just sat down to play it (we were too busy to play during the holidays) and there just wasn't any magic. I think that a game should be fun no matter when you play it, so I am not taking the ""Christmas Magic"" into account in my rating.Overall: If you need a family activity for Christmas time, you could do worse than this. Just do not think that this is a game that you will get out often (or even every Christmas). As with most DVD games, replay value is very limited.",0
"We got this for our son when he was 6 mo old.  He's now 11 mo old and still isn't very interested in playing with it....maybe he will eventually.  Right now he will take the rings off, throw them, then moves on to something else.  It's not very entertaining for him (yet?).  I really liked the price though!! We'll see what happens.",0
"I played this game with my eight and nine year old kids. I am impressed how quickly they caught on to the complicated rules that  change slightly every round of the game. Basically, there are 11 (!!) rounds in this game, and each round, another card is &#34;wild&#34; and each round the size of the hand increases by one card. You can't play this game without a pen, paper, and perhaps even a calculator at the end to tally up the scores.What annoyed me the most was the length of the game. Eleven rounds is veeeeeeeery long. And I paid $11-12 dollars for what is basically a deck of cards. They're not like a deck of normal cards, because they have 5 suits and are missing the 1's and 2's but they are just paper and ink and some instructions. They should have been half that price. I can't really see my family playing it again, as I can't really include my younger kids and they won't be patient for the hour it will take us to finish this game.",0

"This game fails to hold interest for my three and five year old girls.It's a classic and they're still excited to play when we bring it out, but they tire within two rounds, which only last about 30 seconds each. Left to their own, they would just like to pound all the ice cubes out as fast as possible, but since it takes a minute or so for an adult to setup, it's not really fun for anyone. There's never any surprise or challenge as to which cube will cause the bear to fall, so it basically feels like a complicated plastic tic-tac-toe game. On our set, the plastic is poorly finished, so the bear doesn't stand/skate in the slot he's meant to. Perhaps it's better to wait till they are old enough for Operation or Kurplunk. For now, PopUp Pirate is the family favorite. If you have other suggestions, please leave a comment.",0
"My son recieved this toy for this past xmas. Because we have sooo many toys we waited to bring it out . This toy has been sitting w/ all the other toys in the livingroom and my son has only bothered w/ it maybe 3 times. And that is only usually when my 3 yr old daughter is playing w/ it. This toy seems like a better toy for slightly older kids who have started to learn how to count, and say their abc's. It's just not intresting to my son at all.",0
"This kitchen is ok, but there are much better kitchens out there.  The biggest problem is that the oven door and dishwasher door are hinged at the bottom, not the side.  It's awkward for me to open the doors, let alone my daughter.  It's also small, which I liked when I was looking, but I've found that my daughter really prefers slightly larger kitchens (she likes to reach) with doors that are hinged on the side (she loves to open and close the doors).  I'm going with a wood kitchen for the next version and sticking this one outside in the playhouse.",0
"I bought this game because the box looked cute and it had won two awards.  What a waste of money it was!  It is essentially a game of war - you scream and slam your hand on top of the pile if the cards happen to be flipped over in a certain combination (two of the same next to each other (""a double decker"") or two of the same cards on either side of a different card (""a slamwich"").  There is absolutely no educational value to this game, it's just a game that will have your kids yelling and arguing about who won a particular slam.",0
Returned it. No longer the one pictured in the photo (the pink and yellow pair). Now much flimsier and doesn't work well.,0
"Thomas and his friends, Percy and Terence, they load, fill, scoop, haul, and dump their cargo of ""rocks"" around this bustling construction site. The vehicles move backward or forward, it is automatic when your child chooses which area the engines will go to next. A chute that dumps the load of rocks into Percy's tender and Terence will load Thomas with rocks.It was fun to look at for the first 30 mins but then my 30 months old son gets tired of it. There is no hands on interaction except controlling the loader to go forward or backward. I don't think it is a good, stimulating toy for my son!!!",0
My mother in law got this for our daughter's first birthday.  Daddy's name is Mike so she thought this was just the cutest thing because of the name.  Well he lived in our closet for a week before being returned!  It scared the poop out of her!  It would start talking for no reason and the eyes would move around.  We honestly thought it was possessed.My husband got it out to check it out to see if he could figure out what was wrong with it and get her to play with it.  Well she finally would push it around but she kept going back to her Dusty (the vacuum) and leaving daddy to play with the mower.  They had been playing about three phrases worth when the thing burped!  Then I started to listen to it!  It says some of the grossest and rudest things I have ever heard come out of a toy!  We hated to be rude to grandma but we told her Mike the mower was going back tot he store!We bought the original Mike the Mower for my cousin's youngest child a few years back.  He was much more polite and cute!  So until the old Mike is back there's only room for one Mike in our family and that is daddy!,0
"We've only played a few times, but so far we haven't found this card game lives up to the other reviews.  There are basically 3 types of cards: goal, action and keeper/creeper.  Goals can (possibly) change from one player to the next, so you don't plan ahead. Actions can take several minutes to play depending on what they are, so even with 4 playing, it may be 5-7 minutes before your turn comes around again, so hasn't held our interest.",0
not that great a game. have only played like once or twice and don't even know where it is now.,0
Returned it. No longer the one pictured in the photo (the pink and yellow pair). Now much flimsier and doesn't work well.,0
"I swear by the reviews on Amazon.com, but unfortunately I did not read them before purchasing.  Our 4th son just turned 1, and celebrated his 2nd Christmas.  I just bathed him and put the dolphins in with him....believe what you read.  The rings do not stay together and the dolphins really don't sing!!  If you tap the tops of the head, nothing happens; if you lift the dolphin out of the water and slightly &quot;smack&quot; the water with it, it will make a noise.  Quite frankly it works better if you blow into the dolphin.  The baby got a kick out of the toy for a short time.  Maybe I'll keep it just because he can dunk the dolphins and toss them around.  Also, this toy takes up lots of room!!  I gave it 4 stars for durability since it does seem pretty sturdy.",0
"I have purchased 2 adapters and both of them quit working after just a few weeks.  The toy runs well off batteries, and they actually last a while.  I would invest your money in batteries instead of this adapter.",0
Returned this product.  I thought by the picture it was much nicer and sturdier.  The boxes were very cheap and looked like it wouldn't last,0
"I read the reviews, but still ordered the thing.  My bad.  The etching is so thin and faint, you can't see it very well.  If you buy this toy, try it out first.  I wished I had.  Instead, I gave it to my Grandson and let him play with it.  Now, I don't have the heart to take it back from him so I can return it.  What a shame they had to change it.  I remember spending hours with mine when I was a kid.",0
"We received this as a gift when our daughter was 11 months old. She was already at that time quite proficient at ""cruising"", that is, walking assisted by furniture, etc.  She was basically walking on her own two weeks after we  got this.  I was hoping it would be a big help to her, and fun, until she  got to the point where she could walk steadily on her own (you know, around 18 months or so).  The thing is, this toy, as a ""walker"" is very poorly designed: the wheels go so fast when they push it that is just flies out from under her every time she tried to push it. She quickly lost any interest in it.  Even as a ""car"" toy, the same problem.  Many walker toys have a simple mechanism that prevent the wheels from turning too fast so that baby does fall on her face as toy shoots out from under her across the floor.I really can't see paying more than $3 for this at a yard sale.  It  is, in my humble opinion it is an overpriced piece of Made-in-China plastic JUNK. An insult to the land-fill it will inevitably end up in. No thanks!",0
"I have played hundreds of different games, and the game play for this one is one of the worst.  It has too few playing spaces on the board, it has paper bills but almost none are used, there is no excitement in playing, almost all luck in who wins so little thinking is involved, each timed played is about the same, no interaction (play) between players, and there does not seem that any leaning can be accomplished.  The quality is good, and the plastic coins can be used for something else.",0
"My mother-in-law got this for my daughter when she was either 2 or 3 years old.  Sadly, this was one of the only Leapfrog toy that was not a hit.  She played with it only a little bit.  It did not hold her attention at all.  In order to use it, we have to insert the cartridge that goes with the book into the machine.  That necessitates keeping track of the cartridges and books and then lugging everything and the machine with us.  Tag is much better.  Everything is loaded onto the pen and all we need is the book.  Besides, the stories on Tag are much more interesting and there are more activities.",0
I bought this toy because it reminded me of one that I loved as a child.  I was so disappointed when the glue that holds the legs to the bench gave out after just a few days.  I tried to re-glue a few times and gave up when it just kept coming apart.  It's one of those Melissa and Doug fails.,0
"We got this as a gift recently. At first glance it sounded like a good idea, until I read the story.1. The elf ""watches"" your kids and then tattletales on them to Santa. Really? We teach our children not to tattletale. I don't like the idea of anything, real or imaginary being a dedicated tattletale.2. Religion. The elf makes sure you do your prayers. This is a non starter, we are not a religious family, so this book is basically written for Christians, but that seems to be the theme for the whole book.3. Santa is a bad enough idea (he is not ""real"" in our family, just a mythical figure for fun, like Frosty). But this elf is a tangible object and he is supposed to fly back to Santa every night and tattletale on your kids. This is insulting my myself and my kids.This story is basically just a reinforcement of the Santa mythos, ""do good or else you get no toys"". I teach my kids to do good for good sake and the golden rule. I don't want them to think they have to pretend to be good just for a reward or because some magic person is watching them. 'Be careful the elf, Santa or god(s) are watching you!'is a horrible thing to teach kids.The best fun we had with the elf was the fact that is is freaky looking and my four year old is scared to death of it in a Chucky sort of way. So we beat it up and play fetch with it with the dog just to make her laugh and not to fear it. After the holiday season I think I will just toss the elf in the garbage and donate the book.So in short, want to instill fear into your children, buy this product. Otherwise respect their intelligence and invent something new - not just the repackaged Santa story. I'm sure the inventors have made millions on this crap, don't add to it.",0
tiny and impossible to play because you cant control the balls... wtf . .. the idea was cool. . .,0
My son had a plastic slinky before this one. It didn't last very long. I got the metal one thinking that it would. I was mistaken. In a matter of weeks he had managed to get this so tangled up that we had to bin it. It was impossible to get it untangled. The toy has no apparent educational value and the novelty of watching it 'walk' wears off after a few times. I would not purchase another slinky no matter how he bargains!,0
"I first saw this toy online and then went to BRU to check it out with my 6 month old daughter. She seemed interested but I was hesitant because the toy seemed annoying. I didnt really want to spend 19.99 on a toy I couldnt stand to let her play with. Well I found it secondhand yesterday for less than $5 so I thought why not.This toy has got to be the most annoying toy Ive come accross!!!!!There are two volumes LOUD and EXTREMELY LOUD! Why a toy company would make a toy so loud that a child will be playing with that is a foot away from their ears is beyond me.This teaches ABC, 123 and a kind of simon says. The music that it plays along with these teaching sessions are short tunes that are looped over and over for our enjoyment.My daughter is into whacking things right now so that is why I bought this for her. She gets enjoyment from whacking the drum and seeing the lights and hearing the sounds.I hate this toy, its louder than it needs to be and it doesnt have enough variety in music. Im glad I didnt spend the $20 on it.",0
"This game looked like fun but after trying it, I quickly lost interest. I like board games but this one was not my taste. It had too many parts and a bit complicated to play. I suppose if you love Mardi Gras with a passion, then you may like the game. At this time of writing my review it ranked 171,212 of games and toys. I would not suggest buying Party Gras unless you are a real Mardi Gras person or having a theme party. The target audience for this game is low. I give it a don't buy at any price.I rarely give a One Star on any review, but this is not what I expected. I can't say anything good about it and I don't recommend this game.",0
"Will only keep you play for 15' and that was it because there is not that many options.  After that, there is nothing to do.",0
"Of all the First LeapPad books to buy, make this the last one on your list.  My daughter has NO interest in this one whatsoever! &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;( I have two friends who have said the same thing. )",0
"From our point of view, the other reviewer is correct, alot of small children will learn nothing from this drum because to learn something you have to pause long enough for the drum to 'say something complete'. Certainly my little boy wouldn't stop whacking it. (I was afraid he would learn to stutter from the frequent repeats-lol).And I know it's supposed to have won awards, but my two children (girl and then boy) just didn't get it.  My daughter, for example, just didn't like the noise, even at the quieter setting.And my son... well, when he was old enough to sit up and play with this toy, he wouldn't stop making it repeat the first few syllables, over and over.  And later, when he was older (15 - 24 months) he found it boring, having moved on from any stationary playing position. He was action-guy, and far more into Thomas, mega-legos and watching the Leapfrog videos than he was into sitting with a drum to learn his alphabet.Two Stars for us.  It just didn't work as an educational toy at our house.  During the timeframe in which it would and could have been educational the children were too young to absorb the information; and by the time they were ready, sitting down was the last thing on their agenda.**Note:  For alphabet learning, we highly recommend Leapfrogs videos.",0
"Expensive and a little bit of a scam, with the mail in voucher for the caterpillars, PLUS $5 additional shipping charge.  Do not recommend.",0
I am confused about the good reviews. Maybe our track is the only one with issues. The cars that came with it NEVER make it past the second turn. They either just stop or the top of the car gets stuck on the turn above. Anyhow it is a total disappointment. I should have kept the packaging to return it as it is now just taking up space. Don't waste your money.,0
"I don't use the car portion because it's too small for my children (my 14 month old is 33 inches tall).The walker seems better on carpet, but slides too much on hardwood floors. There isn't enough space between the base of the toy and the baby's foot so the walker part isn't really functional either. I'm going to have to give this toy up.",0
"In looking for fun games to play with our daughter, Cootie was one of those that we snatched up.  Remembering playing it as a kid brings back nostalgic memories and so you just assume that it's going to live up to those memories.  Sadly, Cootie does not.  First off, the game can drag on and become ridiculously monotonous once you've attained all body parts except for those six legs.  Rolling sixes can become rare and kids especially can become impatient and bored.  Then you have the pesky problem of poor craftsmanship which leads to body parts being difficult to attach (the legs in particular have a hard time going in their intended slots all the way) or that have a hard time staying attached (the heads fall off with the slightest movement).  My daughter had more fun playing with the individual Cooties than actually playing the game, and she would have had more fun had their heads stayed on while she played with them.  Alas, she played this yesterday and she's already over it.So am I.",0

I thought my son would have fun with this game and he did manage to despite it's overwhelming flaws.  The game is horribly cheap and it doesn't fit into the box once assembled so in order to put the game away you either have to take all the hippos off (and they really aren't made well enough for that kind of repeated on and off) or buy something else to store it in.  How hard is it to make a box that the finished game fits in?  Very flimsy didn't last long before breaking.  A huge disappointment.,0

Here's a creepy little elf and a book.  If you want the elf to cook and buy all the accessories its like buying skylanders or Disney xfinity. Every little extra thing costs at least 20.00. This is awful quality too.  I would not recommend thistle anyone.  Save your money and buy a nice advent calendar instead - I suggest a LEGO advent calendar!,0

This toy was not a hit with my kids.  The pegs that hold the paper in each side constantly fall out.  The game only comes with 8 sheets of cover page which runs out very quickly.  Have not found a re-fill in the stores.  This toy has been shelved.,0
They must really be cranking these babies out as this one was missing one of the 4 main rotors!!!  I used a rotor from one of my older scrapped choppers and it will fly but this bird does not fly well at all. I have probably owned 20+ of these Syma type choppers and as they get older they typically do two things.1. The battery life gets shorter and shorter.2. They become harder to control in that they start doing sort of an oscillating motion if you arent in hard forward flight.This particular unit is doing the oscillating from the get go. Am sending this puppy back!,0
"After 3 minutes the yo-yo just spins in circles and can't even perform simple sleeps.  It either spins in circles when trying to go down, or stays in sleep for and won't come back up.  Definitely need to get a better quality yo-yo if you want to do anything with it.  At this point I can't even yo-yo without tricks and I haven't even used it for more than 5 minutes.",0
"This game is made very poorly. The pieces all have sharp plastic edges. The cardboard 'parts list' piece falls apart and rips upon first using it. I would absolutely NOT recommend this game to others. I don't know if the older version is made better or not. But, if it is, you should get online and find the classic version.",0
"Basically, this is the game of War with a few minor twists.  My four-year-old likes it but rarely chooses it; my 6-year-old is bored silly in about 5 minutes.  The order of the food chain can be memorized by even a small child in about 5 minutes, and after that it is a bit mind-numbing.  Rat-a-tat-cat and Sleeping Queens are MUCH more interesting and can hold our attention for game after game.",0
"Started out as a great road trip activity for my 5 yro  but after the 2 yro used it, it became a mess. The stix became stuck together or had hairs stuck to them. It doesn't come with a reusable bag or anything so they are all stuck in a big ball to the top of the book right now - neither my kids nor I want to deal with organizing them.",0
"My daughter has been playing with the Fisher Price Grand Piano which is by far better than this piano. Fisher Price Grand Piano has the keys light up, has different modes for music, learning (numbers 1-8, colors, pitch, and rhythm), also you can play the piano by tapping the individual keys.This particular Rock and Roll Piano doesn't light up, plays different types of musical instruments, but the keys aren't as fun to play. My daughter played it a few times and went straight back to the Grand Piano. Consider buying that one instead.",0
"The pieces are made of only the flimsiest of plastics, barely fit together and the sticks just slide out of the holes on their own.  The tower doesn't fit properly in the base, making it too easy to pull the tower off kilter.  Lastly, the box is just the wrong shape.  you have to dismantle the entire contraption to fit it back into the box, but the box is very large.  If the box had been made oblong, with the same amount of material, the game could have been left together when stored.",0
"I thought there would be dashed lines or something to show where to add stuff in the book, but basically it's just a picture book that you could stick stuff to. In addition, it didn't come with very many stix.",0
Great and fun....for about two weeks. Then the battery craps out and wont hold a charge anymore. If only they made a better battery....,0
"There are lots of positivie reviews about this toy, which you can refer to hear all the good things this toy has to offer. Here are the I don't like about it:1. It's makes noise that is appealing to children but very annoying to the adults in our family.2. There is no place within the toy to store all the gears and pieces that come with it, so they end up easily separated and strewn around and lost easily.UPDATE: This toy lasted two and a half months before the motor that turns the gears broke and the toy stopped working for good.",0
"We have this same game but it was made in 1967, we just thought the newer version would be more up with the times but we like the old one much better!! This one the tiles are cardboard and the little stand to put your pieces on is also made of very cheap cardboard!! We just gave this game a way and kept our old one!!",0
"This ride on toy was given as a gift for my son's first birthday. My son would rather push this toy around than to sit on it and take it for a ride. He'd enjoy it if I were pushing him around but I'd have to teach him to keep his feet up or it'll hit the wheels. After minutes of pushing and my backaches, the fun is done and he just wanders off and looks for something else to play with. Also, this toy is very lightweight so when he tries to get on or off this bike without assistance,it'll tip or slide, making him lose his balance and fall. There are other toys out there that would be more exciting and less painful.",0
"Don't click buy. Quality is not there, doesn't hold up well. Broke after a few uses. Would not recommend to anyone.",0
My son is really into fishing and wanted a game like that so my mom brought it home for him. My mom is a preschool special education teacher and had this game at her work but didn't need it so gave it to my son. The suction cup piece is a little annoying and my son doesn't really enjoy playing it because there are so many ways to play it. He has more fun just picking them up cause the suction cup is really weak. Could be better.,0
I thought my son would have fun with this game and he did manage to despite it's overwhelming flaws.  The game is horribly cheap and it doesn't fit into the box once assembled so in order to put the game away you either have to take all the hippos off (and they really aren't made well enough for that kind of repeated on and off) or buy something else to store it in.  How hard is it to make a box that the finished game fits in?  Very flimsy didn't last long before breaking.  A huge disappointment.,0
"I got this toy after reading reviews of other parents and thinking my 5 year old son would enjoy it.  He loves to build and put things together, but this does not hold his interest what so ever.  He put 2 of the wheels on and snapped the base together and has not touched it since.  The biggest problem I have with this is that it smells like it was stored in a musty/moldy warehouse.  The box can be smelled from several feet away and it is not pleasant.  It kind of makes me feel like the whole thing is dirty.",0
I have had this toy for 3 1/2 years.  My now 3 year old never really wanted to use it.  A few mins. now and then was all she wanted.  I found that it was always in the way.  When I had my next little girl (now 1) I figured it would be used this time.  No such luck.  The only time she had any fun with it was when her big sisters ran around finding other toys to attach to it.  This toy takes up too much room and is too much money.,0
"We purchased this marble run for our 4-year old son because of his great love for wooden marble run assembly blocks, which he has been using since he was 2. While this set ia  terrific idea and certainly has a lot of educational value, it is made of very flimsy plastic and is in no way durable. Taking it apart and putting it back together in different configurations (which should be half the fun) always proves fatal for at least one more piece of the set for us; they crack and spliter off sharp chards every time. While I love this idea and love wooden marble sets, I regret purchasing this and certainly don't recommend it as it is made of such flimsy plastic.",0
"This toy appears to be good quality and is easy to use and my little boy enjoyed it until it stopped working...within less then a year of occasional use.  Changing out the batteries did not prove to be helpful.  It simply ""gave up the ghost"" and was ready for the trash bin.  Very disappointing.",0
"My mom bought this for Easter for my daughter who was 6 months at the time. I didn't expect her to be able to hit the balls, but when my nieces who are 7 & 9 years old tried to hit the balls through the holes- it took a lot of strength. I don't understand why they would make a baby toy so hard for a baby to use. It's a great concept I would suggest another toy like this from another company.",0
"The diameter is as large as the original slinky, but not the length. It does not have enough mass to store enough energy to make a trip down a flight of stairs. Unless you want to spend time shuffling this thing from one hand to another, and frustrating children with its inability to do much of anything, not a good pick.",0
"My family (sister, mom, husband + me) and I love Phase 10. We're avid card players and do well with complex games. Phase 10 is something we always carry with us on our holidays.Five Crowns is just not for us - its just not challenging enough. We got bored in a few rounds and went back to Phase 10.",0
"The most fun part of a little girl's diary is the lock, and this one is difficult to manipulate and of poor quality.  Also, the diary has only lined, blank pages; there are no pages that are pre-formatted with questions or prompts for the child to enter fun information about herself.  Next time, I will pay a little more for a higher-quality product.",0
The play-doh itself? Of course that is great. The size however. I thought I was getting full size containers. These are small. Not the tiny Halloween sized one but small. For the price I could have got more at target.,0
It's fine for a basketball but what I was looking for was one that would be useful on a dirt driveway. The ball is fine but the description was not really accurate. This would be fine on a hard surface court but not good for the above the garage door type court.,0
"We've played with this tower at public train stations, in private homes, and then I looked at 15(!) of them at a local box store. This is a lousy accessory that breaks almost as soon as you buy it. Or in the case of the box store, only half of them worked in the store to begin with. There aren't a lot of water towers on the market, so you'll probably buy it anyway, but be forwarned that it is the usual Thomas Made-in-China junk that will probably be recalled like all of the Thomas products because of toxic something. Also, the pricing above it exactly 200% of the list price.",0
"My daughter was thrilled to receive this gift. She immediately went upstairs to fix her sick stuffed animals and her brothers.However,within 10 minutes of playing with this doctors kit the case top fell apart. The stethoscope does not fit my petite daughters ears and the heart monitor did not work. The head mirror does not fit on her head or even around her one year old baby brothers head. The blood pressure monitor does not stay together.We will be returning.",0
