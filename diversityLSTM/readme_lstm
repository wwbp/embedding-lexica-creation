- In /preprocess, execute run_preprocessing.sh (using bash run_preprocessing.sh) to get the precessed datasets. You should expect 25 .csv files and 25 .p files
- In /Transparency, execute 'run_[dataset_name]' to get the result (including model predictions and lexica) for that particular dataset
- When you have all the results, in /evaluation, run evaluate_model_lexicon.py to get genralization evaluation results of both model and lexica
