"My new favourite place to eat on Avenue Rd, north of Lawrence. Nice setting inside, and friendly staff. Food came quickly, and our jerk and curry chicken were nicely done.",1
"Ended up going here after a really bad experience with another spa. We were seated immediately, asked if we wanted a drink, and received service right away despite being very busy. The chairs were almost all full. The lady doing our pedicures got right to work right away. Would definitely recommend this place to my friends.",1
"I have been wanting to try this place for so long as a huge Big Burrito fan.  We finally made it for Sunday brunch and happy to report it lived  up to my expectations.  We sat in the outside area (covered but with heating lamps) and had a great waiter.  They have a price fix brunch with includes a drink, app and entr√©e.  We decided to just order entrees and glad we did as the entrees are very large portions. I went with the mushroom and goat cheese omelet but substituted the mushrooms with tomatoes. It also came with toast ( I went with wheat), fingerling potatoes, and choice of a meat-I got the bacon. The omelet was delicious and the bacon was crisp just the way I like it.  We did have to wait a while to get salt & pepper, ketchup and jelly but finally got it all before our food got cold.   Others in my party got the eggs benedicts, shrimp omelet with egg whites and waffles. Everything got good reviews. What I also loved was we got a big pastry basket with biscuits, apple cinnamon muffins and scones.  Al very tasty and a nice starter.  I would really like to go back for happy hour as they have a very nice bar inside.",1
"Delicious. Food has a lot of flavor, big proportions, and worth the money. They deliver, Grubhub, and have door dash. I definitely recommend coming here.",1
"Called them and had them go out to a rental property for a tenant, very seamless. Made the repairs and adjusted the timer,  communicated well with the tenant, got my invoice sent right away, overall very impressed. They were very affordable as well. Will use them again on other properties.",1
"When you first walk in it will trip you out! Very elegant and classy inside. Good luck finding good seating. This place is huge, but almost always packed. Pastries are a total delight! I would come here just for a pastry treat and pass on the coffee. Probably one of the most enchanting coffee shops I've ever been in. A fantastic place to bring a close friend or relative for a long conversation.",1
"I always enjoy shopping here because for me this place is a time machine to when I was a child and I came to this very location to shop with my mother. Being of European heritage we found a lot of our ethnic foods here, brands we recognized from back home in our Native Spain. 

My favourite part of the store is the coffee isle, I love the smell of the different coffees. Plus I get to grind them to my liking, I know that its probably not a big deal as all stores allow you to do this, however, as a coffee lover this is big to me. 

This location much like all the others are very clean, lots of good produce and what I like the most is that the bananas are always yellow, being part monkey I love bananas but only when they are yellow!",1
"What can I say?! Best sushi, best service, awesome atmosphere! This place is alive. When it comes to sushi, I would only recommend this place. We've created so many memories in here. 
I love this place!",1
"Once upon a time there once was a girl who dreamed of a magical place where the Salmon Sashimi is fresh, the Gyoza is served hot, and the Tempura appetizer actually arrives as an appetizer, BEFORE the main course! Welcome to Sushi Xtra.

Anyone who has scanned though my sushi reviews knows I am a big Sashimi lover, but as some of you know it's an expensive addiction to have. I recently discovered that they have Saturday and Sunday (from 12-4pm) happy hour... which of course made me rather happy!

It's a half price menu as long as you spend $20... (which turns out to be $10) I highly recommend the Beef Sashimi and the Fire Dragon Roll.",1
"This place is the best place for a loan. They work with me and after the frost few times of getting a loan, they have extended and increased my loans. The only thing they require besides the necessities is to show proof of employment every six months    .",1
Great Service. The food was good. The lasagna was a little too spicy for me. I want to try their pizza next. Parking was crazy and long wait times are negative factors.,1
My favorite Sushi place in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area,1
"Steve has been my Loan Officer for my last 3 loans; 2 conforming loans & 1 equity line.  I will say Steve's knowledge of the available products & his understanding of the home purchase process is just one of his many attributes.  He's personable, extremely persistent, & very well organized to mention a few.  Being a Real Estate Agent & having a ""really good"" Loan Officer on your team is imperative in today's competitive market.  I'm pleased to say Steve Howard at Homestreet Mortgage is a true asset for my group.  I highly recommend Steve for all our Clients loans.",1
A little hidden gem.  Great selection to choose from.  Will definitely be going back.,1
The doctor has since called and emailed me and asked if there is anything that he can do (I can't imagine there is so I rudely didn't respond) and while it is not likely I would ever go back I really appreciate his efforts. Receptionists come and go but this is the doctors practice so the stars are back up...,1
Very Nice musical show in Pallazzo. But this is a Final show in Las Vegas. I love to see show like this. Everything in the show is perfect and nice. I will miss this show. And I hope Pallazzo bring some show like this in soon,1
"My husband and I had an exquisite meal here last night.  The server, Sean, was very knowledgeable and efficient. The sashimi appetizer was light and delicious. My husband loved his steak and I really enjoyed my sea bass. (Loups de mer). The asparagus side dish was remarkable and had a bite to it. All in all, I highly recommend stripsteak.",1
"I have been waiting for a pho place this good in my area for a long while and I couldn't be happier!

I ordered the pho normal on doordash and even though the delivery said it would take over an hour on a busy night, it got here in around half if not less that time.

Minus delivery costs, the pho itself cost $7.25!!! What!! So filling too.

Wow. Just wow. I am pretty picky with my pho and have high standards, but this was soooo good.

The 'pho normal' still has a spice to it, it has a nice peppery kick and the broth is truly on point. Clean, well done and flavorful broth. I got the well done beef even though I always order rate, as I worried it may not cook in the winter cold on the way here. It was still good but my assumption was very wrong and I would get the rare beef next time lol. I just found the well done beef to be too chewy but that's my general preference when it comes to pho. The meat itself was tasty.

It also came with bean sprouts, a lime, basil, and some hot sauces.

This is bound to be my regular pho spot. Soooo happy!",1
"Staff is very sweet, everyone is very accommodating. Everyone is full of smiles. The dim sum variety is huge and everything is perfectly seasoned. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because the food wasn't hot enough (I bit into some cold pieces) and the tea cups needed to be washed better!",1
"Penny is a dream. Amazing skills and one on one service. Clerk was a bit annoying, she kept talking to penny and asking questions while she was working on me. Learn the trade or ask them to wait.",1
"Little bit busy, but was well taken care of.  Beer selection was great, bartender complemented every selection. Only problem was it is a burger place too, and too much bun for the burger.  Bun bites are bad. Give me more meat.",1
"Best breakfast burrito ever! I can't wait to come back to Phoenix so I can eat here again. I don't even like soy cheese but the country breakfast burrito rocked my world.. I would have loved to eat it with a fork and knife on a plate, but even in its basket the taste was amazing and I know I'll be craving it until my next Arizona adventure. Service was super friendly, my latte with hazelnut milk was on point, and the garlicky salsa that came with the burrito was pure magic. 

They only serve breakfast, and the menu isn't up on the board as that is full of all the bakery treats and beverages. I'd love to see a larger menu, or even some menus by the door for more accessibility. Luckily I knew about the food from yelp, so I just asked the people in front of me to pass a menu back. It's a little awkward to not be able to see a menu until it's your turn to order if others are in line behind you. Overall, great job Nami! You've got to taste it to believe it.",1
"Good Day to all reading my review of Mimi's Thai Restaurant located on Gerrard Street. 
This restaurant is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered.
From the moment we arrived we felt like we were in the Four Season's Hotel!  It was incredible.
The proprietor took care of us with silk gloves on, she was that smooth of a restauranteur!
The menu is quite extensive and is available online if one wishes to peruse the menu before arriving.
The Pho was so plentiful, tasty and hardy.  It was bursting with different layers of flavour and textures.  The accompanying garnishes personalize your Pho to your liking.
The cold shrimp rolls were exquisite and stuffed so full of wonderful ingredients and flavours.  The accompanying dipping sauce was the perfect foil for the roll.
The Restaurant was clean, organized and very well managed.
If you are looking for a culinary feast, Mimi's is the only place to go!  They certainly know how to deliver!

"Warning: This review contains a lot of gushing and high praise. If this sort of unabashed adulation makes you uncomfortable, you might want to turn away now. You have been warned. 

I HAVE NEVER HAD A BETTER BRUNCH EXPERIENCE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  The White Brick Kitchen really knows what they're doing and I don't have even one solitary complaint (and, believe me, I'm very picky and thoroughly enjoy complaining when it's warranted - so I would if I could, but I honestly can't).  Allow me to regale you all with the delicious tale of my delightful brunch. 

My friend and I were fearful that we would have to wait for a table when we arrived at 10 am on a Sunday.  It was such a pleasant surprise when we were seated immediately and quickly presented with both coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming, laid-back and cozy.  I already felt very content as I sipped my OJ, little did I know that I was about to be sky rocketed from content to off-the-charts-euphoric.  It seemed as though we had only just placed our orders for the Scotch-ish Eggs when they were set before us, as if by magic. The service was so fast that it verged on ridiculous, but the quality of the food did not suffer in the least.  On paper, the Scotch-ish Eggs sound super tasty (two panko fried soft boiled eggs, hollandaise, greens, buttered baguette and potatoes), but nothing can fully prepare you for how transcendent this dish truly is.  I am awestruck by how perfectly cooked the soft-boiled eggs were in spite of the fact that they were breaded in panko and deep fried.  I have no idea how they still manage to maintain the optimal runny yolk consistency while creating such a crispy coating on the outside of the egg; it's nothing short of incredible.  Every component of the meal was outstanding - from the dressing with a subtle hint of Parmesan on the salad to the golden brown potatoes.  I can't say enough good things about this dish, you really have to try it!

I'm excited to return to The White Brick Kitchen soon to try their other dishes (if they're anything like the Scotch-ish Eggs, I am definitely in for a treat).  I loved that even though they're offering high-quality food, the prices are very reasonable.  Great spot, great staff and sublime food. You really cannot ask for more!",1
"The bottom line: Just off the strip, almost at walking distance (unpleasant walking, that is...) is this small hole-in-the-wall shop that surprised us with authentic, friendly, tasty Thai food.

The Pros:  The food was as original as I remembered it from Thailand. The service was friendly and authentic. The place was packed with locals (as oppsed to us tourists). The price was more than fair.

The Cons: The location is a bit off the beaten path.",1
"I want to live at Veggie House. Seriously,  how does Chef Kenny do it? Lettuce wraps? Bomb. Giant bowl of miso soup? Delectable. Mongolian beef? The ish! And it's all meatless.  We ate soooo much but at the end of the meal we didn't have that dreaded feeling of ""the itis"" since everything is on the healthier side. Everything was served so quickly,  if you're in a rush then this spot is for you. Also if you like crazy delicious food that won't leave you feeling guilty then this place is also for you. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's vegan and vegetarian,  the food is as good as, if not better than its meat filled counterparts.  I'm mad that I'm not eating there right now. Chef Kenny, I heart your face and your food. Don't be scared when you see a face in the window at night, that's just me waiting for you to open.",1
"Thank you to the friendly staff and always beautiful nails, never a wait for me but I do go earlier in the day. The nice accommodations to the kids is a plus, hot coffee or the tea is another plus. Come here and you will leave looking fabulous. Thank you Melinda for the friendly service.",1
"I had the most lovely brunch at Bouchon during my Vegas Christmas wedding weekend. They offer very, very tempting brunch selections like chicken and waffles which looked mouthwatering. However, on this chilly Vegas morning I was slightly hungover and craving a more traditional (non traditionally late) breakfast. The ""Breakfast Americaine"" fit the bill. It came with crispy bacon, the best breakfast sausage I've ever had, eggs any way you can imagine them, and toasted buttery Brioche. In addition, it came with a breakfast pastry, juice and endless coffee.

The chocolate croissant was the best chocolate croissant I've ever had, besides of course ones I've made in my pastry career and eaten fresh from the oven. The banana muffin was very moist and very delicious. The coffee was amazing and overflowing. Our waitress constantly warmed and refilled our cups. The service was great. I will be eager to return, next time for dinner!",1
"We have stayed here a few times to have a ""staycation"" and have been able to get the room for a very reasonable rate. The location is great and everyone that works there has always been very friendly. Had we paid full price for the room I would not have rated it so highly because the room is just ok and the beds are kind of hard. Worth it for the location if you get a good deal and are staying for one or two nights.",1
"I love Pei Wei!!! The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that I think I love China Way (see my other review) more and its more authentic I believe. Everytime I have been to Pei wei though, I have not be disapointed. I have several favs. The honey seared chicken is amazing, as are the Pei Wei spicy beef, lettuce wraps, and Dan Dan noodles. The orange beef , pad thai, and chicken lo mein are pretty good as well but I rarely order them because I love the other dishes more. I love that you can order noodles with your entrees in place of the rice but having the option of brown rice is nice as well when I am trying to watch what I eat. Another tip if you are watching calories: you can get any main dish with the chicken steamed instead of battered and fried. Pei Wei also makes the most amazing crab wontons with the best sauce evar!!! One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to crab wontons is when there is no crab. Hello, crab is in the name so it should be present in the dish! At Pei Wei, you can actually taste and see the crab in their wontons. Mix that with the sweet chili sauce they serve the wontons on and these are great! Don't get me wrong though, I've tried some of their other dishes that I was not a big fan of. Their thai coconut chicken was a little bland, the sweet and sour chicken is not what I look for in sweet and sour chicken (the sauce wasnt very strong), and the mongollian chicken had a strange flavor that I didnt care for. But to each his own, people have different taste. Anyways, Pei Wei is one of my favorite places to go and the prices are relatively cheap. I agree with one reviewer in why would you go to PF Changs when Pei Wei has the same food pretty much at a fraction of the price not to mention the portions are bigger.",1
"Fun, fun, fun. 

Here to celebrate the birthday of one of my son's friends. Be warned...Saturday afternoons can be PACKED! We arrived early enough to beat the crowd. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the food...and drinks. Pretty tasty and the menu was extensive. We had wings and sliders. Wings have a kick so they aren't for amateurs. And the sliders inspired me to go buy Hawaiian rolls and make some myself! They were really tasty. 

Bring your wallets. The kids will want to pack their cards to pack in the games!",1
"I like this place a lot.  It is relatively cheap and even cheaper with the student discount.  The mango shrimp quesadilla is really good, and I would definitely recommend it.  The restaurant is clean, which is a plus.  The server is nice, which is another plus.  So, overall, i would recommend this place definitely.",1
"I had my first experience the other day with 
Mackenzie.  From the moment I stepped into this dispensary I knew that it would be a home run.
The flower is delicious. You get to see what you are getting, it is weighed right in front of you eye. 
I tried their cartridge ""Kind"".  It blows Timeless and Dream Steam away. 

Gorgeous place with lots to look at with great stocking stuffers.  

I will return. 

Best programs in town 

McKenzie was promoted so my go to person was Jason.  Quite a rock star Bud tender.",1
"Valet in front of hotel
Great texmex food and very tasty 
Staff is very nice but was super busy when I visited so service was average 
Food tastes good
Booze over priced a bit but it's Vegas
Tortillas cost $2 for 4 
Salsa is ok",1
"Super delicious modern Japanese food. Intimate, casual setting. Great selection of beers. Had the most amazing curry dish. I wish we had a location closer to our home as we'd eat there a few times a month for sure!",1
I couldn't be more excited to have found this new place.   Food was yummy and prices very reasonable. Service was great and they even showed the kids the lobsters! Will be back and will certainly recommend to all the people I know. Felt as if I was in New Orleans :),1
"As a vietnamese food lover, the pho soup of this place seems a little bit modified to me. Not a huge fan. But Their Bun is very tasty. Love it!",1
"Came to visit Phoenix to go to a Seahawk game.  First time I visit the bar, my husband's second. So glad my husband brought me here.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!  Where do I start...  Staff is awesome - very friendly, welcoming - even to us who were dressed in Seahawk gear :).  Patrons equally as friendly and social.  The place itself has a great setup.  You can stay inside or enjoy the great set up outside.  Whether you are inside or out, you can listen to great music or enjoy one of their many tvs to watch football anywhere. Finally, the prices and food is great.  Next time I am in Phoenix this will definitely be our hangout.",1
I have the peach pies for Thanksgiving in the family raved about it! Just picked up a mini lemon meringue and couldn't pass up a mini quiche. Looking forward to trying the green chili pork pot pie family style next time!!!,1
"I needed a good place for a pedicure and after reading several reviews on Yelp about this place Dyanna L and I gave it a try. 

Since I got there first they warmed up the water for us while I picked my polish. They were sweet enough to wait tell Dyanna got there to start my pedicure. Meanwhile the water was all warmed up and I stuck my feet in and felt the wonderful jets! It felt amazing! Once Dyanna got there they started our pedi's and they even worked in Dyanna's other friend. All three of us were offered water which is always a nice touch in my book. I was super impressed with my pedicure. Every place I've been to in the past ends up hurting me because my feet are so sensitive, but they did not hurt me once. I was also excited when they massaged our legs with hot rocks, Talk about feeling pampered! It was great not to feel rushed after they painted our toes.They just let us sit and finish talking. Tina was so kind as to help me get my flip flops on. Super sweet of her. 

Their prices are also excellent $25 for my pedi and if I wanted the deluxe it's only $10 more!! It's been about 3 weeks since my pedi and the paint has not chipped or anything. I can't wait to go back for a mani and a pedi. I've been telling all my girlfriends this is the new spot in Henderson. YAY Nail Zone!",1
"For those who enjoy Italian, and really who doesn't, then you are not limited to Pizza, especially when there are exquisite Italian restaurants like Prop. It was a Friday night, and we were out with another couple - so I was forced to order fish -but  I was not disappointed - we shared, shrimp crostini, salmon ricotta crostini and grilled sardines as an appetitizer, (I'm sure the other couple ate more than their share) - the apps were thoughtfully prepared, and abundant in fish. Not to mention that having such a variety of fish to choose from is a rarity. The mains (no sharing) we had a hearty fish stew,  grilled salmon and the special Spigola and- Sea Bream - wow, this isn't even a seafood restaurant. we were overwhelmed, the fish properly cooked - showing off the true flavour and proper texture of the fish - beautifully prepared. But it's not just seafood, it's a fine Italian dining, at very reasonable pricing -  I watched other tables enjoy a liver dish, and risotto nero, a black ink risotto.  The portions are filling and you don't feel bloated, and the freshness and quality of the dishes sets Prop ahead of some of the other restaurants in the neighbourhood.",1
I went here for brunch and had the make your own breakfast sandwich. The food was great!!!!! The atmosphere is even better!!!!,1
"What an adorable spot!  The pink and white color scheme and cozy booths made me feel so 1950s, I wanted to throw on a poodle skirt!  We stopped in on a Sunday evening around 8pm and the place was packed.  Luckily we didn't have to wait but five minutes for a table.  We split a burger and each ordered a dessert.  The burger came with chips and coleslaw, all of which were subpar.  Our ice cream desserts however, made up for the burger and sides.  Skip the dinner options and splurge on the ice cream options instead!",1
"To say that this is one of my favourite coffee shops in the city would be an understatement. Furthermore, there has not been one single individual whom I have bestowed the wonderful introduction that did not share the same love and enthusiasm for the place. It is an old brewery house that has been revamped, while preserving its historic and warm brick stoned and wooden infrastructure, into a coffee house. A beautiful crystal chandelier hangs mid-air which compliments the surrounding providing a feel of stepping into a moment of the Victorian Era. At the intricate counter, which is decorated with delightful treats teasingly awaiting to compliment the delicious coffee drinks available, stands a beautiful and shiny imported,right out Italy, espresso machine that can be admired and appreciated by espresso connoisseurs and those lack there of. 

This two floored coffee house is spacious, cozy and accommodative for those who come in pairs or small groups. Even more so for that lone escapist two may just wanna curl up with a good book, a warm cup of coffee and sweet pastry? Or perhaps thats just me:) There is also a small parameter that is marked as an extension to this house. Small tables and wooden summer chairs are set up for the taking to those who want to absorb the sun and good weather while enjoying a good session of people watching. 

AND ON THAT NOTE:

Almost every weekend there are events! Stands fill the stoned path streets of Distillery District to make a pleasurable marketplace made up of artists, cloth and jewel makers, cooks and other intricate product entrepreneurs showcasing and selling their products. Expect live music of different genres to be visible and heard in resonance from the dead center of this little bazaar. All to which can be witnessed as one people watches from the little place of reserve set up for Balzac customers to enjoy. 

As lovely as this sounds and truly is, there are some short-fallings; or at least that, too, is open to interpenetration. There is NO WIFI! Yes, no wifi! Talk about truly stepping into a time in the past. So bring a good book, good company or your own internet. Furthermore, considering how unique and popular this gem of a place it, those who know of it will stand in the line that can sometimes be as long as a half-an-hour wait! The wait can be alarming and nerving for those used to instant-gratified coffee individuals. Just keep in mind that there is a reason why those in line have also been waiting as long as you have.  

All in all, this place is wonderful for escape, to cozy up on your own, with someone or a small good company, with a book or a laptop, whatever ones heart desires, it is highly unlikely to disappoint and a time well wasted.",1
One of the places where I regularly take out-of-town visitors for a bit of nostalgia.  I especially like it during Christmas time as they decorate with period decorations to match the setting.,1
"Hey, remember when this place opened?  It was like a revelation-- no longer do you have to go to Capp's Comics & be stared at like you were a criminal just because you were a 13 year old kid buying TMNT sourcebooks & Robotech VHS tapes!  Anyhow, I've never been a comic collector, so I can't speak to that, but I bought many an RPG manual here, once upon a time.",1
"While recently visiting Cleveland and looking for a good place to enjoy a nice meal on a Saturday night with an old friend, she suggested we check out what is apparently the hottest new spot in town. I was of course intrigued when she mentioned that they had Mexican food - as I am a huge fan of anywhere where there are margaritas and chips and salsa. 

We called earlier in the day in hopes of getting a reservation, but were told they were booked and we'd have better luck simply arriving and waiting for a table. When I got there around 7:45 I was told the wait would be about an hour for a table for three, so we promptly posted up at the bar and got ourselves a cucumber and spicy mango margarita - both of which could not have been more different or more phenomenal. The cucumber marg was cool and refreshing, a delicious summer beverage and the mango was spicy - seriously so - and delicious - the perfect pair with their guac and chips. 

We were seated in a little under 45 minutes from the time we walked in, which wasn't bad and went fast while seated at the bar, enjoying the first drinks. Immediately when we sat down we began perusing and knew we wanted some queso and guac. It took a few minutes before a server appeared and when he did we promptly ordered some cucumber guac and some chorizo queso. The queso and guac were unusual - the queso in an amazing way - it wasn't so cheesy and contained a very generous portion of sausage and onions and was served with tacos. The guac however wasn't really my jam - I didn't love the cucumbers in there and found myself eating around them. 

We got the gouda dumplings which were unlike anything else I've ever tasted and were amazing. We also tried the shrimp taquitos which came in a sauce that was literally unreal - seriously I was dipping my chips in it and would have eaten it with a spoon. We also go the brisket tamales which were good, but a little sweet for the mood I was in that night and not enough relleno sauce in my book. We also got a side of beans and rice and I rarely say this, but the rice was heavenly with some lime on it - seriously the best white sticky rice I've ever had. 

The prices for the quality and portions were great - for two apps, two drinks, three side dishes and two mains we paid $90 and took home two large to go boxes because we just couldn't finish everything. This place is 4.5 stars, just can't give it the full 5 because the service was a little slow and I didn't dig the cucumber guac.",1
"I've been here enough to know I love it.  Picture a place opened by hipsters that love Asian food and reaaaalllllly know how to cook and blend flavors.  

The tables and setting are nice and not overdone.  But still quality and comfortable. The music is good and just loud enough so you can have a private conversation at your table without anyone else overhearing it even though the tables are close.  

The food is outstanding and the menu is unique.  I really enjoy the soft boiled egg on just about every meal. 

Lunch is a smaller menu but quick and wonderful.   Dinner is even better.  The quality of the ingredients and the final product are really that good!

Service is very attentive and follows the anyone can help you mantra.  

Come for lunch or dinner, but get here before you cannot get in without a wait.",1
So spicy and flavorful! Shrimp Pakoras really good and not too oily. Chicken tangra really tasty too (if you like chicken tikka masala you'll love this!). Appreciated the fact that the manchurian seafood rice actually tasted like seafood (instead of a oil-flavorless-spicy taste) and did not have too much food coloring.,1
"Really a fun place.  Great atmosphere, attentive and friendly servers and very good pizza and wings.

The only reason I would not give it a 5 star rating was that they were out of three of the beers I really wanted to try.

Definitely still a place I highly recommend.",1
Food is super fresh and delicious! Loved everything and wished I had room for more. Amber took great care of us. Can't wait to go back and bring more friends and family.,1
"Sammy was an outstanding waitress, food was great, but salsa needed to be thicker but it was really good albeit too thin! Perfect noise level for conversation!",1
"Loved going here for happy hour. They had the BEST cucumber salad, I could eat ten bowls a day. Went there once a few weeks ago craving some sushi and salad, parked, walked up to the door, only to find that they had CLOSED. Went next door to Humble Pie and the guy at the front said they shut down January 1st. My heart sank. This is the second Sushi joint that has closed in the past few months. Ten on Tatum was equally amazing and had great food. Sad day when great sushi bars close because the chains get more business, even if their overpriced food sucks.",1
"Fish and Chips in the dessert - this cheezy place is incredible.  Sign me up!  $8.00 and I close my eyes and I am in Northern Scotland at Banchory Lodge. My first trip here I sit with an Arizona Senator and his family. NO CREDIT CARDS - all outdoor seating and barrios neighbors but still, well done.",1
"The staff was friendly and attentive.  I had egg whites and they where fluffy and done right.  Also crispy bacon, toast and well cooked hash browns.  It was a nice big portion all tasted really good.  I will be back!",1
"I will honestly state that the pre installation process can be a bit disorganized.....BUT

I recently had Paradigm Luxury Vinyl Plank flooring and new mouldings installed on Saturday, March 24, 2018 and I spoke with Marshall about obtaining his best installation team since I'm quite hard to please.  Well the installation went flawlessly, they had a can do attitude, listened intently,  did a fantastic clean up with every piece of plank and moulding meticulously placed!

To me the quality of the installation and competitive pricing is of most importance and Cloud delivered!",1
"Definitely a wow experience.  This was my first time to this location. It was clean and well stocked.  They listened to what I was moving and professionally - not pushy - suggested a few things that really helped my move go better.  
Thank You",1
"Great service, good food and reasonable prices. The lamb shank was excellent. I would recommend if in the area.",1
"How can only one other person have reviewed Childsplay?  Are yelpers not parents as well?  Ok, technically, I'm not a parent by biological means.  I'm a Step-Mom.  The friggin' best Step-Mom you're ever gonna meet!  I'm recommended by 100% of my step-children and their father as well.

Sorry, enough about me.  Let's talk about how great I am to have taken my youngest Steppie to see ""Peter and the Wolf.""  Thanks to her Music teacher, who teaches to the only class of redeeming value being taught in the ""Excelling"" Scottsdale Unified School District, dear Steppie has fallen in love with Sergei Prokofiev's ""Peter and the Wolf.""  She will hum the different instruments' parts while riding in the back seat of the car and will yell out, ""Guess which animal that was!""  She's adorable.  

There I go on another tangent.  Apologies.  When I saw that Childsplay was offering this adaptation of PATW, I figured it was time to expose the child to a little culture and the great world of...The Stage!  It was presented at Tempe Center of the Arts (which will receive a positive review from me when time allows) in their Studio.  This offered an excellent, up-close view of the little stage from pretty much and seat in the house.

The actors and their costumes really made this a treat for both kids and adults.  As any Muppet Movie of the 1980s will exemplify, the presentation must be entertaining more to the children's parents than to the children themselves.  Why?  If we A-dults sufficiently hate the means of entertainment that our little ones enjoy ever so much, we will find ways for said means to be accidentally, say, sucked up by the vacuum, or buried in the litter box, or somehow otherwise rendered unplayable.  Even if it means seeing the pall of disappoint envelop their cherubic faces, it also means never hearing that damn, purple dinosaur sing another creepy, mind-consuming ditty.

The cast was made up of truly talented and enthusiastic artists.  Sure, there was a bit of ""over-acting,"" but this was a Childsplay production, not a staging of ""Remains of the Day.""  The costuming was brilliant, detailed, and full of color and texture.  And the Q and A session held after the performance allowed for the children to come up to the stage to speak to their favorite characters, ask questions about method-acting and stage production, etc.

Completely affordable and a fun afternoon that my step-daughter is still talking about six weeks later.",1
"Honestly a little too sweet for my liking but I should have expected that getting the triple threat beaver tail, since it was covered in Nutella, If I go back I think I may opt for a different flavor, but regardless it was good, service was quick, good location ....if you love sweet you will love this place",1
"First visit here and I can not find any faults.  The place is nicely decorated and in great shape.  I only say this because so many Chinese restaurants I go to look like they never repair or update their furnishungs.  The menu has all the popular items but is not overly huge.  We ordered egg drop and wonton soups and then  Mongolian beef and Curry chicken.  Everything was served in a timely manner, looked great and tasted even better.  Very happy we decided to drive a little farther for this experience.  I think too many times we settle for what is convenient instead searching for better",1
"Our dinner was delicious! We had several entrees and each of them was great including the chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, chicken korma and saag paneer. The staff was very kind and attentive and the restaurant was a great atmosphere, even for our loud family. Highly recommend!",1
"My fiancee and I each have a dish to test a new Thai place.  Her's is Mee Krob and mine is Pad Prik King.  Both at Thai Delight exceeded any we've had. I am based in L.A. but have had Thai food all over the country and this is as good as it gets.  She is from Chicago and has traveled a lot too.  We were both impressed.  They also make one of my favorites that not every Thai place makes, Pumpkin Curry.  It was very delicious as well. They will make things as spicy or not spicy as you specify which is useful for all different palettes. I really can't say enough about a simple place that just has the best darn flavor around.  That's what it's all about.",1
"Surprised my boyfriend for his 30th birthday by taking him here this morning! Price was fair (we even opted for the photo/video package which is totally worth it), staff showed excellent customer service, and the process was very smooth and well-timed. They allot for 4 hours, but we were there just under 2 (probably because we were the first group of the day). Highly recommend these guys!",1
"I am so glad I discovered this place and have been coming here for the past several months. This is the best place for organic chicken feed, and we're not talking about that gray stuff from Cargill (Nutrena). Every time I come here, they are very friendly and introduce me to a new product with a sample. Because of that, I now use a natural dog supplement that is also encouraging my finicky yorkies to eat voraciously. Thanks!",1
"BEST BBQ PORK EVER

I stumbled upon this very unassuming place about 15 years ago when I  worked near by. At the time a good portion of 'cha su' and streamed rice was a 5er$.
FFWD to 2007 and my new BF (still my BF) lives not far at 7 & Yonge. Ya! Lost and found. I'm a kid of immigrant retauranteurs and we would go every Sunday downtown for 'real' Chinese food when I was a kid.
I only get the cha su, not into duck and just haven't tried the crunchy skin pork that looks juicy and amazing.

Here are the facts:
What its NOT:

no atmosphere, not a 'nice' place to stay and eat
absolutely NO FRILLS
despite the sign (I laugh every time) it is NOT FAST, they have ONE speed,(never gets further than first gear)
 one person cutting the meat and I know that will never change
service is not all smiley, basic to the point but not rude
be prepared to wait in line, bring a novel, lol

What it IS

best Chinese bbq I've ever had in my life
they've been around a LONG time, which tells you there's a reason and the long line ups  of my other Asian kin is also very telling (we are a very picky sort;)
I wish I wish they had a veg I could have to with my rice n pork - maybe one day

I usually get 2 lbs and 1 lb is gone a couple hours when it gets in the door between the 2 of us. it's fresh and delicious.
I don't care about the price (which, according to my frugal mom is so expensive!) haha

Just go get the food, take it home, be patient in line.
Boy, I love this place!

PS I tried the wings - pass on those, kinda dry lack flavour",1
"Modern, clean facilities with a great view of chefs creating hand made noodles and dumplings. We ordered various potstickers and steamed dumplings, all of which were excellent and delicious.  Staff was kind and attentive. We will likely be back, and with friends.",1
"Great service, knowledgeable parts help, even  though I didn't buy my GSXR here, they treat me like I did.",1
"Love this store.  Best in the area, newer and cleaner and doesn't have weird smells.  The deli section is great and although they say they don't have a new cake decorator they have stepped up their game!",1
Found this place on our way out of Vegas!  So delish!  Great comfort food for sure. Recommend the Kentucky fried chicken!,1
It's great!!! Try the Lemon Grilled Shrimp tacos!!! And they have skinny girl margaritas!!! It's a tad growded but it didn't bother us.  We waited only for 30 min.,1
"I moved to the area a few months ago and been going here due to the location convenience. They changed management a month ago and services got so much better, friendly staff and nicer nails, same price
The new manager Kelly also does facial services and very knowledgeable of her products, my friend had her face done and just loved it!",1
"This is by far some of the best Greek food I've ever eaten. I'm Greek and I have been to Greece many times, and the food here at Greektown is as good or better than anything I've ever had. 

The owner is great! He makes you feel like you're in his own home. You can tell by the food and service that this is his home.",1
"The absolute most fun in Vegas and the cheapest!!! This was my fourth trip to Red Rock and my son and I made it to the top!! (Top of the amateur part anyways, 4 or 5 hundred feet I would estimate) I would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to get in a little workout. The first stop on the 13 mile scenic drive is the best.",1
"These guys are top notch. I noticed I needed an oil change on my 2012 VW Touareg TDI. I panicked and called Myers on a Tuesday and asked if they could get me in Wednesday and they said nine or ten thirty. I picked ten thirty and arrived early the next day. They took me in, early and had me out by ten thirty. Their prices are reasonable and the folks are friendly.",1
Pat is the man! He will take care of you! Went in for a couple new tires walked out with 4 only cause they were looking out for my safety. My tires all needed to be changed and they had many options to fit my style of driving. Thanks guys!,1
"Good, fresh food.
The wraps are **HUGE** - easily two meals.
I enjoyed the chicken curry over rice, and loved the fresh-from-the-fryer falafel.
Nothing in the ambiance department. (Unless you feel that Subway and Starbucks are the height of class) - but quick and tasty.
Limited seating.",1
Highly recommend. They went out of their way to take care of a broken washing machine quickly knowing i had been having issues with the warranty company for weeks. Very responsible pricing as well,1
"So many great things about this resort.   Loved staying offstrip for a quieter experience.   

The good:.

 Staff are great (see exception below).   Most staff here were fabulous.  The check in was smooth, the valet staff are lovely, one of the cleaning staff even offered to wait for me to get my Starbucks when she saw me hesitating to leave the guest access only area because I forgot my card. 

The amenities here are awesome!  The pools are gorgeous and one pool has a sand bottom portion with a sand beach.   

The only thing I will say needs to change is the pool staff.   For the most part the wait staff was okay but could definitely improve but what I found awful were the lifeguards.   The first day we were at the pool three lifeguards just talked amongst themselves and bottle flipped to keep themselves busy. Yes, bottle flipped - my 8 year kids favorite game.  There was even a point where a young child in the pool went face down in the water and the adult with them didn't notice and guess what? Neither did the lifeguards.   No kidding someone is going to die on their watch if they continue like this.  The second day here it was two lifeguards having a bromance looking at each other the whole time instead of at the pool.  I get that it's not that busy but it's a job that has some dangerous consequences if you aren't doing your job even for a moment.  Instead they were passing a life float between them for fun, talking about picking girls up at the bar to the point my husband had to leave becauae he didn't want to here their childish talk anymore.   

Otherwise a fantastic stay.    I'd return here for sure.",1
"I love how cozy this spot was.  There is a such thing as being too big and BWB hit the nail on the head in terms of size.  It's so intimate. easy to talk to the person sitting next to you, if thats what you so desire.  Or you can immerse yourself in your own conversation.  The bar staff here was amazing for this event and worked so hard to make sure everyone was taken care of.  We loved the beer flights.  Even I am not a fan of IPA's but the IPA they served in the beer flight wasn't too bad, sure it had the bitterness at the end but a lot easier to drink than most IPA's.  My favorite had to be the Saison beer, it had just enough sweet notes to captivate me.  I do want to talk about my favorite thing though, which was our charcuterie board.  We had the brewer's reserve which I think was a perfect combination of meat and cheese.  The fig spread was amazing but I am also a sucker for fig anything  I do wish they had given a little more of the fig, as not all the beer:meat:fig ratios were balanced and thats kind of a huge pet peeve of mine.  Regrettably I didnt find where the pistachios or almonds fit in with that board but that is just my opinion.  Overall this would be a spot I would definitely come back to again.  I forgot to ask if they serve any kidn of wine but even if they dont, they have a couple beers that I, pickiest of all beer drinkers, enjoy.",1
My favorite fast food place . Everything tastes fresh from lettuce to tomatoes to burger . I just love it . Animal fries is something to try if it was your first time trying it.,1
"Place is great for watching a game! Great service, food is good, especially for a ""bar"", and they probably have the Bestfriend Bloody Mary I have ever seen!",1
"Wow, what a great experience!  Mastro's is definitely a once in a lifetime place to eat.  

From my initial phone call with Britney, I knew this place was first class.  She was very friendly and helpful.

We arrived a little early for our dinner and they seated us in the Treehouse!  Awesome decor

Tim was our server and he was friendly and very helpful with our selections.  

We ordered both steaks and fish.  All the entrees come a la carte.  The steaks were steaming hot as they arrived.  Melted in your mouth!  My sea bass was delicious.  

For the sides, make sure you get the mac & cheese, delicious!  We also had the sweet potato fries which were crispy and the broccoli.  The hot bread was also very delicious.

With no alcohol, our dinner for four was $275 plus tip.  Not an everyday place but definitely a once in Vegas trip.

The next morning Zach called us to follow up on our experience, I have never had this happen from a restaurant ever!  Nice touch",1
"Very friendly staff,  had nice music playing and the decor is hip and modern.  I like that they had local artists paintings up on the wall and they even had a suggestions board for cream cheese and bagel creations. 
The bagel I ordered was fresh and very tasty.  Not at all like your typical chain bagel shops!",1
"We checked out this place for lunch on a Sunday. Amazing food. Service was just meh, but not sure if our waitress was just having a bad day. We had the steak and the burger ;some of the best we've had. The steak was so juicy that it ranks in the top 3 we've had ever. Great ambience as well. Definitely must try place in Vegas.",1
"I have been going to the RWB in Mesa since it opened and the food is pretty darn good.  As a vegetarian I have tried every possible combination of food on the menu that is vegetarian, but I typically will just stick to the pizzas and salad. The eggplant Florentine is very good too, but the serving is enough to get you through 4 meals!  That is true with most of their food, the portions are large, so don't be turned off by the prices.   I would have to agree on the comments below on the service; it's nothing to write home about. The only thing I will say is that I know several people who are regulars at the brew and they are treated like gold... so maybe there's something us occasional patrons are missing.  If you are area, I would definitely recommend RWB.",1
"We came thinking it was Kabuki and boy was I surprised when I walked in and there was Ryan, my favorite Sushi Chef (from another place which shall remain nameless)! I was extatic!

I love the choices, the sauces, and how friendly the chefs are. 

If you like spicy tuna, you have got to try the ""Crispy Rice"" roll. Yummmmmm! 

And their Japanese Lasagna, made with crab stick....that's always my dessert! 

Ummmm, did I mention the baked green muscles....oh now I am getting hungry again! 

With their prices just right, their drinks keep flowing, the fish is OH so fresh, and then the staff being so awesome! You just can't go wrong.

It's a little hard to find, nestled in on the right hand side of Target, but its worth looking for! 

I have found my new Sushi spot!",1
"Food is awesome. I highly recomend Loco moco if you like hawaiian style. I also enjoyed breakfast menu which my other parties ordered and shared together. Two tips: you have to expect of waiting for15-20 minutes(worth it), potatoes as a side on the plate is seasoned and salty(tell them light seasoning or without)",1
"First time eating here and was very impressed with ""The Cheef"" sandwich, great flavor. Friends said the pizza was really good too.",1
"Big O tires was very accommodating, friendly, and efficient. They removed the screw in my tire immediately while smiling the whole time. Great service and complementary repair--I would highly recommend!  They have my business now going forward.",1
"Clean, friendly and very user friendly. Close to Wonderland and a great choice of fun for a rainy day. 
Reasonably priced and food available for purchase. They are generous with portions as well. 
Shoes are typical and very used as expected. 
Bring your own socks!!!! 
Sensors for lanes actually work! Don't pass the line:)",1
The new menu is awesome.  I had the steak bowl with a fried egg in it and fresh avocado.  It was way better than the bowl at Diego Pops.  I highly recommend this place.  Awesome service and friendly staff.,1
"In line with and one of the best massages I have ever received. After searching online for an excellent massage therapist in the area, and reading reviews I decided to try Massage in Davidson. I wrote first, requesting no candles due to allergies, communicated the type of massage I required, with a note to get back to me if this would work. Allison was very communicative and fit me in next day. 
I was expecting the fancy office in the pics but instead was invited to Allisons home, a quaint little antique duplex. She had rocking chairs on the porch and I plopped down in one since I had arrived 15 minutes early. At appt time I went in and am happy to say that all of the reviews are well deserved. Do yourself a favor and give yourself the gift of a massage at Massage in Davidson.",1
"Came here for dinner on Saturday night.  Easy to get a table and the service was perfect, never felt rushed and never waited for a refill or a dirty plate to be taken away.  Food was delicious and the margarita was the best I have had in quite awhile.",1
"I'm usually a kofusion girl but my friends and I decided to try this on a whim based on a recommendation from another friend and I'm so glad we did ! We came for lunch and I got 2 rolls for $8.48 which ended being $9.29 with tax but still, I got 11 pieces for $9, which is cheaper than what I would spend at most sushi places. I got a shrimp tempura roll and a Philadelphia roll. The Philadelphia roll was good and the shrimp tempura roll was AMAZING. I would definitely come back here again, although I know the 2 roll combo is more expensive at dinner time so I'd probably come for lunch if I really wanted a great deal. All in all, I'm really glad I checked this place out, my friends and I left very full and satisfied !",1
"I pass this place everyday  on my way home. I decided to send hubby for an almond croissant. It was delish! Delish  I tell you. Words cannot describe it. It had the right amount of everything. I think it was about 3$ for the croissant, in my opinion it was well worth it. I am unsure of everything they sell, but once I go for myself  ill do a review for sure!",1
We ordered our wedding bands and my engagement ring from Ritani who is a vendor to Kleinhenz. They are so wonderful! They take such great care of you. Offer free cleaning or sizing anytime. I will always make major jewelry purchases from this great place!,1
The service here is great! The people are honest and friendly. I got the best quote here compared to the many other places I checked. Parts came in within a reasonable amount of time and the work was done in a timely matter as well! I would recommend this place to anyone and my friends!,1
"This is my first time at not only Yogurtland, but this type of place where you get your own Yogurt from a machine! At first I was intimidated but my friend helped me through the process of creating my own frozen yogurt treat. The best way to not be shuffled along a line is to just go right for the flavor you want; why be held up behind a person who is getting Vanilla when Peanut Butter (my current favorite) is all the way near the end? Just go get it! Don't wait! But be polite if you're squeezing in between someone!!

The flavors rotate everyday - you never know what will pop up unless you go to the http://www.yogurt-land.com/ website to view all their flavors and hope they have the one you want to try when you arrive *lol*! The toppings at the end of the station usually change but not as much as the frozen yogurts! The staff is great to chat with, the atmosphere is great also - it's always busy with college kids and families, and I love it because they're open so late on the weekends! You can also eat outside which we love to do because we can be as loud as we want!

So if you're by ASU or in the Tempe area, you defiantly need to give this place a try if you're in the mood for frozen yogurt!",1
"Had a late lunch here today, the service was great. He was friendly, quick, and helpful when I asked what was in the veggie pho, he went to ask the chef what's in it. 
The veggie pho was amazing, the best by far I've had in the Phoenix area! Flavorful, not too salty, and with fresh veggies and jalape√±os to go in it. 
My boyfriend enjoyed the shrimp spring roll things and his shrimp pho as well. 
We will definitely go back next time we want pho!",1
"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Bravo! The vodka sauce is EXTREMELY hard to put down when you have them with garlic knots. The lobsta ravioli is one of if not THE best ravioli dishes in Las Vegas. The service was great and they keep the place looking authentic but not run down. The fried rice balls with marinara was an awesome appetizer. Total bill for 2 with glass of wine each and app was $60. Such a great place, will definitely return!",1
"We were seated on the roof top patio, very nice! Got to see a lot of the downtown happenings. The pasta here was delicious! Andrew was our server and let me tell you he is the best, funny, attentive and gave his recommendations which by the way were great! The atmosphere here was lovely, it's nice for a date night or to take the whole family out! Coming back for sure!",1
"Delicious. Found out about it from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. It is none of those, but it was fantastic! On the trip through Cleveland we decided to stop here. Unfortunately, it didn't open until 5pm, so we waited four hours for dinner. It was well worth the wait. We sat outside on the large patio, it was a beautiful day in Cleveland (yes, it happens). The service was very good and helpful with what to order and how large the portions are. The machaca, coffee and ancho braised beef was amazing!!! Also, enjoyed the goat cheese guac and chips. The camerones (shrimp in a garlic wine sauce) was delicious. Dessert was fried ice cream. It was fantastic. More than enough for two people and very satisfying. The machaca and fried ice cream are must orders when in Cleveland.",1
"Went here after seeing a positive review in Phoenix magazine. Did not disappoint ! We had the chorizo and black bean queso - seriously, possibly the best appetizer I have ever had. We both ordered rather eccentric sounding main dishes. I actually was presented a different meal than I had asked for, but when I tried it, it didn't matter! Everything about this place is great - the indoor seating area is small but great furniture and chandelier gallery. The outdoor area is nice too. Staff friendly and timely. Definitely coming back again.",1
"My first experience at Georges Brasserie came down to this simple mathematic equation.

$25 Brunch Bar + all you can eat Oysters on the half shell +$12 bottomless Mimosas = extreme happiness and gluttony!

Picture yourself, Sunday morning, seated across from you friends. Shades on, fresh coffee and hot Beignets served on a fresh, white snap tablecloth. The patio oozes European flair. Slicked back hair waiters twirl platters of Oysters and Mignonette, followed by Grilled Shrimp daydreaming on Gruyere Polenta. Carafes of high grade Mimosas magically refill themselves. Now Chilled Shrimp dance the Cancan around eggs and prime rib as they push perfectly Carmalized Cr√®me Brulees closer and closer to tempt you. 

Georges Brasserie truly is brunch Fantasia! Tout est merveilleux!!!",1
Now a Close out King.  Great stuff and prices.  Well organised.,1
"This store has some excellent customer service.  I've been going here for years and always get asked several times if I need help.  I'm a needy kind of person, lol. So I know  I  will get  some great advise when I go here.  In this day in age with service it's nice to know where I can find some awesome assistance.  
Don't forget to ring the bell when going out the door, they have that up there to tell the employee's they were helpful and you were happy with your service. :)",1
"The crew here takes great care of the customers. I have very ticklish feet and they know just how to treat them. 
    The place is clean and the prices are fair. 
Get your loved one a gift certificate because you care and it makes a wonderful ""takes up no space"" gift to have them treat themselves.
   If I'm ever going to have my feet taken care of, Sunset Nails on Stephanie is my first choice.",1
"This place is great! An excellent selection of dim sum dishes. Fresh! Noisy because busy. Good value.
One of the best dim sum experiences I've ever had. 
The atmosphere is fairly standard but dim sum restos that I've been in aren't really big on that anyway. I found the staff helpful, you might have to flag them down to get their attention but once you have it they are quick to sort out your questions/requests. Definitely worth a visit.",1
"Everything we had here was fantastic.  We sat at The Kitchen Table which is a glass-box, plancha-style kitchen, The Kitchen Table offers up to 10 guests the chance to watch the chef cook and prepare the meals.  We tried a lot of things including Dates, Blue Cornbread, Braised Lamb Belly, Goat Cheese Dumplings, Gem Salad, Bone In Kurobota Pork Chop, Roasted Pee Wee Potatoes, Blueberry Crumb Cake, and the wonderful Blue Corn Short Stack.  All the things listed were amazing both in how cooked and the flavors used.  If you like cocktails and trying new things order the Mercury Mirage with is a delight.",1
"I couldn't wait to get home and yelp this place. Five stars, too! 
After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago, I hadn't been to Bandera until tonight. WOW! It was a GREAT experience!!! 
We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous! 
Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries. 
Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage! 
The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY! 
I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top!
Next time, I'll take some pictures (if I'm not too hungry)... 
I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean...
REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!",1
"Perfection. Seriously. I felt like a princess walking into this beautifully modern but inviting nail salon with glittery silver floors. And I felt like a million bucks when I left! 

I've never seen a nail salon with such welcoming decor. It's usually the same office-like chairs and oversized, slightly uncomfortable massage chairs. The furniture here is contemporary but so comfortable and welcoming. I wanted to sink into those pedicure chairs but only had a manicure on my first visit. The salon is SPOTLESS. I was told that the pedicure tubs have their own disposable liners, which makes me feel so comfortable with how hygienic and clean this place is. 

Jenny did my manicure and she was fabulous. Very personable and so meticulous! I chose a pink glitter polish but expressed concerned that it wouldn't be dark enough with two coats. She initially tried and realized it wouldn't be, so she removed the polish and started over with a darker color for the first coat. I so appreciated how hard she worked to make my manicure perfect!  

My only complaints are that they are closed Mondays and Tuesdays (I've been meaning to come here for quite some time but, ironically, the only times I found myself available for pampering were on Mondays so I missed out for quite a few months... finally, when I was off on a Wednesday, I was able to make an appointment). I'd also like a separate drying area for my nails. I'm obsessive about making sure my nails are completely dry prior to leaving and I would literally sit for 40 minutes under the dryer if it meant they would be hardened and dry and I wouldn't ruin my lustrous new manicure! LOL. 

I can't wait to go back and get a pedicure next time! If you go and you're a first timer, mention it for a one-time 20% off discount. I so wish I had saved my first time for when I was doing more services.",1
"Fantastic sandwiches, especially if you go with the legendary Dutch Crunch bread. They also have authentic SF sourdough which is very good. Sandwiches are huge, though quite pricey. Service can be a bit slow if there's anyone in line ahead of you. Be aware that all sandwiches are hot ""unless otherwise noted"". Found out the hard way when ordering a ham & swiss by phone that I wanted cold - wasn't asked which way I wanted it, so hot it was. Also had more stuff on it than I asked for. Still quite tasty though.",1
Thank you Green Valley for making this stay such a great experience. You have definitely made up for our last stay. Kudos to you.,1
"This place was amazing! The spicy hummus was in my veggie based bowl and the variety of toppings made each bowl personal. Definitely the new Mediterranean spot in Anthem area, go support your local businesses:)",1
"From the moment I spoke with Jennie on the phone, I knew this company was the one I wanted to work with. She had Matt come out as soon as possible to diagnose and fix a malfunctioning irrigation system. Matt was out the next day and within an hour, had diagnosed and fixed the problem.

Fast, efficient, friendly and courteous, Luxe Outdoor Environments now has a loyal customer. They are dedicated to quality with great customer service. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of quality outdoor services.",1
"This was my first time visiting a Corner Bakery Cafe, and I'm so glad I tried it out! It kind of reminds me of a Panera mixed with a Kneaders Bakery and Cafe. It was pretty busy since they just opened, but we got our food very quickly. They had a lot of options for decent prices, and I was very tempted to buy all of the baked goods. I tried the Choose Any Two option and got the Berry Pecan Salad + 1/2 Chicken Pomodori Panini. My meal included chips and a pickle. I also had the blueberry pie and toffee cookie; they were absolutely heavenly! The panini was delicious, and the salad looked and tasted very fresh. Everyone who worked here was friendly and helpful. Plates and trash were immediately cleared from empty tables, and we had a few people approach us to see if we needed anything. An employee also offered us a sample of their lemon pound cake (yum)! It seems like you are getting a lot for your money, and I will definitely be coming back!",1
"Great prices and caring staff. I had a faux suede purse that I took to their store to clean. Man oh man they did a great job. It needed a soft hand
as it is faux suede and the color was intact. Before cleaning it the owner and myself made sure it was a faux suede (it was stretchy) as to not damage the purse. Very nice customer service and great prices. Thank you",1
The sampling of Asian cuisine. Beautiful room and quality food and staff. Great oasis to escape to!,1
Great butter chicken. My wife and I split one order with rice & nam bread. Super succulent. The bread was fresh and light.,1
"out of all the cafes in this town, this was one of the best but also one of the priciest. had a very good new york steak here for 22 and the chicken Marsala was very good too. the apps, we had a southwest egg roll that was surprisingly spicy and  good, i like it hot too.
all in all i would spend that much on something else where, but i did enjoy the meal.",1
"Fast and friendly! I went in on a Friday, maybe 30min before closing and the customer service I received was still top notch. I didn't feel rushed and they allowed me to try as many glasses as I wished. After picking the glasses and going through all the options, I was advised the turnaround is usually up to two weeks (which is expected).  Wednesday the next week I got a call saying my glasses were in and ready to be picked up! The fact they were so kind and quick with making my glasses (correctly) really makes me happy I decided to drive across town to try them out.",1
Pizza and wings were good. Service and atmosphere friendly. Would definitely come back.,1
The Master Spa has the best foot massage that i ever had...i am from Los Angeles.. there are many of foot massage places there...but none of them like this one..so friendly and has very good skills..especially the therapist Lin-Lin...wow..so amazing!! Definitely recommend and will come back every time i visit vegas~~~ Nothing more but A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++,1
"I can't think of a reason to take any stars off of this place. It's a great breakfast! The service kept our drinks filled at the height of a Saturday morning breakfast, AND our delicious breakfast choices came out surprisingly fast! I had a scramble/skillet and my date had a little of everything. It was all yummy. There's a patio as well when it's not too hot out for ya - always a nice feature in the Phoenix area.",1
"Fantastic find! Maybe a bit pricier than some Greek competitors in the area, but absolutely worth it. 
-laid back atmosphere
-open late
-fresh fresh! 
-try the tabbouleh - best I've ever had!
-generous portions",1
39.5 weeks pregnant and such a relief for my tired and swollen feet! Will definitely go again. Perfect date night!,1
"The movers at Skinny Wimp were amazing. Efficient, friendly, and prepared with lots of supplies to protect our furniture. Allen and Gabe were a pleasure, working quickly and carefully, even in 120 degree weather.",1
The food is awesome every time we are on the side of town we always have to stop here and eat. very friendly Great customer service . if you don't stop to eat here you are missing out !,1
"Absolutely love this place. The food is delicious, the options are outstanding and the prices are very reasonable. We visited regularly when on vacation and now that we've moved here, we go even more often. We enjoy taking our family here when they visit. Dietary concerns are a big issue for me, so having gluten-free options is priceless!",1
"We were overall pleased with our purchase. No pressure at all even for add on at finance close. The reason for 4 stars is only that when we were presented with the ""deal"" we had a web price that they didn't show us. They touted transparency but thankfully we did our research first. Hopefully we will be happy with service when that is needed. Overall happy though.",1
This place is cool. Walking thru a pawn shop into a speakeasy setting was a first. Inside was great and the small plates were too. Really good place for a group of friends to share dishes. Expect to spend $50pp since you'll be ordering multiple dishes.,1
"very awesome dive bar. the staff is super friendly. although we were their as tourists one of the things I liked about this place was that it wasn't flooded with tourists like the rest of the bars in downtown. we met a group of friendly locals and had some friendly bouts in billiards all night. good beers on tap. id definitely recommend the ""mad &noisy IPA"".",1
"I have been to the others (Vegeway, Veggie House) several times, so of course I had to try this place. The restaurant decor is... not attractive. But whatever, the food is good, great variety. Similar menu to veggie house, but with some added stuff like sushi, ramen and pho, etc. Our server was Li, and she was so lovely and sweet. She made the experience even better. I will go again.",1
"Finally made a stop here after wanting to come for over a year since moving to Toronto! The reviews are not lying, this place is SO friggen GOOD! And the lady behind the counter is just the sweetest! Highly recommended for anyone (+meat-eaters!) To try deliciously made vegetarian/vegan options!

I had the Muay Thai Salad. A bunch of organic spinach, daicon, radish +other organic ingredients on a bed of glass noodles in sesame peanut sauce. Highly recommended for peanut sauce lovers (of which I conveniently am :D)!! Very glad I chose their food for my first visit but everything here looks delish!!",1
Really fresh flavorful friendly atmosphere. Staff very friendly and eager to take care of you really like having something like this on the west side of town,1
Stopped in today for cigars.  Great help and a nice selection.  The expansion is very nice.,1
"Thank goodness Hubby and I missed breakfast cut off at our hotel and wandered over to Caesar's.  Mesa Grill was my favorite place that we ate when we went to Vegas on our honymoon 2 years ago and it was just as good for brunch!  

We were seated almost immediately - a pleasant surprise and ordered Bloody Mary's.  They had a kick but not too spicy.  Bread basket came out - jalepeno corn cakes, blueberry coffee cake (soooo good!), and candied berry scones.  I loved the variety in the bread basket.  Too bad we didn't think to ask if we could bring it home. 

My husband had the Mesa Grill burger cooked medium (barf!) and fries and I had some egg dish that had a green chili sauce that was layered on crispy blue tortillas.  It was heavenly.  

Our server seemed like he was kind of having a bad day but he was handling it like a champ and having a sense of humor about it.  He was a sport and kept our drinks refilled and food out on the table as soon as it was ready (or so it seemed).

I can't wait til next time we can go to Mesa Grill.",1
"Wildflower, THANK YOU! Whoever reads & handles customer comments really cares about their customers experience and satisfaction. I've made various observations and complaints and they've obviously been talked about. Greg, the manager has done a great job implementing things. I couldn't believe when I walked in he said with a smile ""Hi Glenda"" Whoa!!!! Impressive! The staff is very welcoming and accommodating, ""I'm particular"" so if you want the best cooked eggs and bacon Daniela is your girl, consistent!!! If you want a dirty, dirty Chai Tea Latte have Iskim or Desiree make it! Great atmosphere, great food, great service. Kudos! Staff who cares and wants the customer to leave satisfied. Thanks for starting my mornings off with a smile! I know I can be rough! I'll be back!!",1
Been to this a couple of times. Excellent food at good prices. Love the tea they provide at the end. Nice friendly staff definitely a place to visit,1
"Last night a friend and myself decide to try Wvurst. I had been there before, after work before the kitchen was opened and had a couple of beers. Excellent beer selection in both draft and bottle.

The set-up is supposed to mimic a German beer hall. Rows of very clean picnic benches line the room and there are maybe 10 seats at the bar. That's where we sat.

We both ordered off the Game part of the menu. My friend had the Bison Sausage with blueberry maple and I had the Wild Boar sausage with mushroom and tea. We both thought they were excellent. I had a small plain fries with mine which was quite enjoyable. 

The service there is excellent, and I found the servers and bartenders to be very friendly, personable and efficient.  We were there around 8 so I am unsure how long a line-up to order food would be when it is crowded. Then again some places take forever to come to your table to serve you, so this might work better.

Wvurst is a sausage place and beer hall with a great atmosphere and vibe. It is a place I will definitely be returning too.",1
Great lunch..perfect wings and a Greek salad.   Service was perfect too.  A hidden gem. Tv's for everyone,1
"I have been going to Sparkle Nail Bar since they opened in May 2015 and I refuse to go anywhere else! I absolutely love Roben & Eva, they take care of me every time I go in there and I never have to wait. Roben always does such an amazing job & he never fails to impress me with his work. I've been going to Roben for over a year now, he is very sweet & cracks jokes all the time and he always gives me exactly what I want. Love ya Roben! thanks for always keeping my nails beautiful!!",1
Went there for an oil change recently.  Didn't know if there's going to be a wait time so I called ahead and make an appointment.  In and out of the store in under 30 minutes.  Great service and friendly staffs.,1
"The first time I went to Harris Grill, I had been living in Pittsburgh for about a week and was on a first date. A year later, my love for Pittsburgh, my date, and Harris is unwavering. I've gone to Harris about twice a month on average since, whether it's because friends or family are in town and I want to go someplace that's both fun and has an approachable menu; because it's 11 p.m. and I need to go someplace where the kitchen's still open yet it isn't overwhelmed with a party crowd; or because I want to enjoy happy hour food paired with an extensive beer list.


I haven't been dazzled by everything on the menu, but I generally think the food is good to very good for the price and atmosphere. The only thing I really haven't liked there was the ""Lasagne Aubergine,"" or eggplant lasagna, which I thought was too salty and generally unappealing the one time I had it.

On the ""okay"" list: chicken quesadilla (also a bit too salty), spinach dip, and tots

Good: pierogies, vegetarian chili, Jamaican jerk wings, and macaroni and cheese

Very good: ""The Clogbuster"" (what I consider to be a real salad, not some pathetic bar ""salad"" with a bunch of fatty things atop two pieces of iceberg lettuce--this one has a bunch of root vegetables, peppers, et cetera)

Love: turkey burger, ""Macaronis et Fromagede Langoustine"" (seafood mac and cheese), and dry-rub bacon wings


The Harris staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive (even during busy times that are typical of nights, weekends, and happy hours). The bar really isn't big enough for the kind of crowd it draws, and it can get pretty packed and noisy, but when the patio's open, it helps relieve some of that crowdedness. Oh, and the parking on and off Ellsworth is a nightmare. Still, I think it's worth a visit for anyone who's looking for a no-fuss night out.",1
"Another amazing cafe in the Kensington Market. Very long, spacious cafe. Reminds me of Tokyo Smoke on Queen West. Their drinks are great, service is wonderful, and the wifi is very good. They'll have their patios open when it's warmer.",1
"Pieces Unimagined is a shop not to be missed- they offer a wide array of gifts, decor & furnishings for any budget. My husband and I had a custom kitchen island built with them, and it turned out beautifully! We were able to design it to best suit our needs, which included some unique & complex features. The end result was solid, precise and full of detail. Working with Ky was fun, and communications were always prompt and clear. PU focuses on incorporating salvaged and vintage materials into their designs, giving each item a story of it's own. Their furnishings are true works of art, and their pieces are reasonably priced considering the high level of quality in which each is crafted.",1
"As we were finished with out road trip and heading back to San Francisco, I said why not try one last place! This came up and I saw the unique flavors and that sold me so to Sweet Republic we went!

Karen was an absolute sweetheart and so helpful even when we had questions about a cactus road we were trying to find!
We tried many flavors and they were all amazing and different!

Mint ice cream- One of the very few places that I've been to that has REAL mint leaves! This is how mint is supposed to taste and I don't even like mint that much and I loved this!

Almond butter crunch-  This tastes EXACTLY like roca! it was so amazing! We got it in a milkshake and it tasted so good that we had to order another one! That's right another one! Calories? What's that?!

Belgian chocolate- I usually don't go for chocolate flavors even if I love them but this one really hit the spot! Very different that regular chocolate!

Brownie swirl- Oh who could resist such a awesome flavor with brownie bits inside of the ice cream? I can't!

You really can't go wrong with any flavors, you can tell they really worked hard on their ice cream and use only the finest ingredients! 
Thank you again Karen for being awesome!",1
Everything was phenomenal from start to finish. Beautiful fish and delicious dishes... our server Jerome (Jerone?) was superb and made a tasting menu for us based upon our preferences and it was perfection. We can't wait to come back to Vegas and dine here again- what an amazing experience! Morimoto doesn't disappoint!!,1
"The design is very well thought of, there is a modern feel to it. The food was delicious. I ordered the veggie, goat cheese tart. The crust was perfect, the mix of veggies was on the point and the amount of goat cheese was just right. I am usually skeptical sometimes when it comes to goat cheese, it can take over the taste and ruin the flavour of the meal. 

The cocktails are pretty fabulous, and the service was great.",1
"Signing up with  State Farm, I was a bit skeptical that saving money was a possible. After being with Geico for so long and actually taking a penalty, a bump my monthly insurance cost. I decided to look elsewhere for a better rate and service.

At this time and junction in my life I reached out to a newly acquired friend, Kasey Estes, a team member of Joy Estes State Farmer crew insisted that I should drop them a line and run some quotes. 

What impressed me more than receiving a better, less costly, monthly premium, was the outstanding level of customer service and over a abundance of attention you get from Joy, Kasey and the rest of the State Farm Crew.  In a world where going the extra mile and getting the personal touch fades as society be comes engrossed with technology and were the art of communicating on the phone is pass√©. Joy and Company make you feel wanted and apart of their family.",1
"The staff is so friendly and great with the kids. Me and my whole family including the two little kids come here to swim inside AND outside, play basketball, and I come here to workout! The facilities are wonderfully kept clean and there's an activity at anytime of the day or week to participate in. My younger brother loves the basketball courts. The swimming area is always bustling with kids of all ages. 

Sometimes you can't find enough lawn chairs because there are so many people, but usually there's at least one to make it work. I've never had to leave or even sit on the ground because there wasn't room. The water is always clean and so are all the play areas! The workout area is always clean and are working properly. I've never used their personal trainers but I heard they're good. 

Overall this place is awesome. Such a great place for family and for something to get your exercise!",1
"In the year since we moved to Charlotte, this is my favorite Asian restaurant.   I had the Beef Rendang which exploded with flavors in my mouth, wow!",1
"This place has awesome food and amazing service!!! It was our first time visiting the restaurant and the servers were very helpful and friendly. We tried a combo that included steak and brisket for the grill, soup, kimchi fried rice and a beer (plus all the dipping sauces, the sides, besides the kimchi and bean sprouts). The meat and all the sides were very fresh and the servers cooked everything perfectly. The combo could have easily served 3 or 4 people, so needless to say we had a lot of leftovers. I'll definitely come back for more Korean BBQ and for their great selection of beers.",1
"Best Ever,  we go as much as we can.   Impeccable food,  service could use some coaching but you hardly care when the food arrives and almost forget when the check comes,  it is so inexpensive!!!!  This place is always packed,  and for good reason.",1
"Wow, amazing. Fresh fish, great taste, amazing value. Too bad they don't have one in LA",1
"Ok, so other than the skull art all over the place, which kinda freaks me out, this place is amazing!  It's a bit small inside and not ideal for eating in, just a few barstools, which is OK, I'll takeout and eat my yummies at home.  This little joint in Port Credit is worth a little trek out of your way.

Three tacos for $10?  Yes please!  Fish, chorizo and babacoa for me.  Great guacamole too, and churros for dessert to finish things off.  Yummy!!!",1
I am wondering how I can find my long-lost friend Artley who use to work as a driver at Ralph in the 90s.  My name is marva.  simoneharvey1athotmail.com,1
"Had breakfast here, ate outside, beautiful and great food. The cafe au lait was really good, I had the eggs Benedict with salmon and my wife had pian perdue (French toast) both were EXCELLENT, very well prepared and great plate appeal",1
"I couldn't wait for this place to open and see what the food was like. The name in itself had me anticipating their opening. To my greatest delight the food was great, fresh a complete bang for your taste buds. Friendly staff and great music. Absolutely love this place will make this my go to spot for lunch. Keep up the great service guys. On the corner if Warm Springs and Amigo.",1
"TRY THE BBQ MAHI MAHI TACOS!! This place was on point. Busy as hell and the service was amazing. The food came out fast, hot, and delicious. Chicken Tacos, Diablo Salad, you cannot make a wrong choice....and their Sangaritas are to die for.",1
"First time I've had really authentic tasting Pizza Marguerite since I was actually in Naples, Italy. Delicious.",1
"I went to Paris 66 with my husband and friend for Sunday brunch around 10:30 a.m. We were immediately greeted by a chef who looked up from making a crepe to say, ""Bon jour!"" We were advised by the hostess that we could be seated immediately but because one chef was out for the day, our wait for food would be a little longer. I appreciated being told this before we were seated so that we could decide before getting settled whether we wanted to stay and wait. We decided to go for it since we weren't in a rush. 

We ended up ordering (homemade) croissants and (homemade) jams as an ""appetizer"" to tide us over while waiting for the food. Since those things were pre-made on site, we were served them immediately. They were DELICIOUS!

Aside from the slow-to-come out food, the service otherwise also was a bit slow (ie, the waitress). She could have been more attentive given that we were being so patient and there for such a long time. 

As for the food when it did come out: Two of us got savory crepes and one got a sweet crepe. We were all extremely pleased with the quality and tastiness of the food. We each cleaned our plates and noted that we'd be back. The French ambiance is really well done, too.

It seems that Paris 66 was not prepared for its own popularity and is experiencing some growing pains as it gets the pacing of its service correct. I hope they will learn from the foibles of their first few weeks. We will definitely be back!!",1
Eric at Bell Lexus is the greatest.  He always goes above and beyond. This dealership wants to make sure that all the customers are satisfied by meeting commitments and their attention to detail. I come all the way for Payson for my service.,1
"I was really look forward to go to a Bobby Flay's restaurant but after being there i think the food was little bite over rated. The food was good and everything was great but it just wasn't what I thought it could of been. 

The food itself was pretty normal nothing really ""in your face"" or ""has haves"". The sauce in itself was just to die for but than Bobby is a master saucer.

The pricing was normal not too bad for vegas.

Service was nice and friendly but could be a little more personal.

note: mean reason I put 4 star is b/c of Booby. If it was another places it would have been 3-3.5.",1
"Large gambling spa resort. Many restaurants, poker room, meeting rooms, pools and 2 wings of hotel rooms. Nice views from almost every room. They also have a tub and shower in their standard rooms. Good light blockout curtains. Outdoor pool.

What makes this place extra fun is that you can walk out of the casino and go to an outdoor shopping mall with restaurants, retail and hobby stores. There is actually fun restaurants here and interesting retail stores from jewelry, clothes, to hiking wares. Most bars/restaurants feature gambling and great beer/alcohol features.

Can walk even farther to a Whole foods and pizza place. Lots of stuff.",1
"Oh yes - yes and yes. Come for the banana walnut muffin (even if you don't think you'd like that) and stay for probably anything else. Maybe a 4 egg omelette or scramble or somesuch? Really, just wading through the menu is almost enough entertainment by itself. It just boils down to the simple question: What do you want?!

I almost got several other things, but took a little coaching from our very capable server and opted for the Crazy Chicken Omelette. There's guac and mushrooms and sliced chicken breast inside, with jack cheese on top. I went easy on the cheese, asked and got a side of jalape√±os, and was in heaven. Very satisfying and not too heavy. I asked for the sour cream on the side; no problem. And with many of the entrees, like this one, you're guaranteed to get the seasoned potatoes -- which may seem a little too perfectly symmetrical to fully trust, but dang, they're good. Not too spicy nor salty, but still with a pleasant kick.

This location is plenty big, but doesn't feel like a barn. You may wait a minute or two for a table - but generally, it's looks like they're very accommodating and will make things work pretty quickly. The kids menu is crazy reasonable, and for the grown-ups, it's not bad, either. Lots to try, lots to enjoy (the pancakes look great; and the taste from one of our's Denver was outstanding). Really, I think you'd be cool with just about anything here. Even the coffee is above expectations -- it's fresh with a good simple flavor.",1
"This guy seems too good to be true the first time!

Putting our name on Chris's list to get in FREE and FAST?  I was definitely a skeptic.  I scoured through his Yelp reviews, read every comment on his Facebook page and search the internet for days looking for a catch or false advertising claim...and I couldn't find anything.

I was bringing a group of 11 girls to Vegas for my sister's bachelorette weekend and we wanted to get into the clubs without having to wait in line or pay a cover...and Chris's Free Vegas Club Passes helped us do it.

The first night, we went to Moon and Playboy at the Palms.  He texted me around 5pm and told us when to get there.  We just walked right up, said we were on Chris Hornack's list and they checked us in.  No cover, no waiting...awesome.

The second night, we headed to Tryst at the Wynn and had the same good experience.  It was a little harder to flag down the guy with the clipboard (with so many people trying to palm him money to skip the line).  Once we got his attention, we said we were on the list and he let the whole group in...even our one dude didn't have to pay!

Having never been to Vegas clubs before, I didn't know what to expect.  I heard rumors of long waits and high covers, so signing up with Chris seemed like the smart thing to do.  I really can't understand why all those other people standing in line didn't do the same....

Thanks Chris!",1
"You must go here for lunch if you are in Montreal - amazing. 
Avocado and bread find a new life in a marriage of taste here that is INCREDIBLE.",1
What a great alternative to a supermarket cake. I've never been disappointed by the cakes I've tried several. My favourite is the Red Velvet. I ordered online and picked it up at the store location a seamless and beautiful experience. You can see them preparing the lovely desserts and they always have a window case full of beautiful  dessert treasures.,1
"Great service, alcoholic drinks reasonably priced, food wonderful!!!!  Can't wait to go there again!!!!!  Huge difference from the previous owners!!!!!",1
Jose always comes in clutch always a good experience walking in always provide water for the waiting guest,1
"Gave us free Sombreros at taco fest, this place is great! And they have really awesome margaritas!",1
This park just recently opened.  One of the nicer family parks I've been too that have a lot of fun spots for the kids and plenty of picnic table space.,1
"I had dinner at Humble Pie in Scottsdale last night, the bar tender Marcus was very polite, had great recommendations which were awesome and has a great personality! The bar has a great set up, had it been a little warmer I would've sat at the outside bar.. They did have heaters but inside was just as nice. I had the huge wedge salad, the lettuce was crispy, all veggies were fresh but the only ingredient missing was BACON! Shame on you, Humble Pie! I also had the margherita pizza only because I had to try a pie! This is a must try and enough for two, maybe 3 if you have starters.. No need to over stuff yourself! If I have another chance to come back while in Scottsdale, I definitely will!",1
"One of the tougher entry level hikes in Red Rock.  Be prepared to complete destroy normal running or walking shoes on the sand stone and sharp rocks on the way.  There is no clear path up but if you follow the trail signs, then stick to the left of the gully on the way up you should see many footpaths.  You want to aim yourself to be about 100 feet to the left of the flat rock face/wall of Turtlehead, then wrap around the back and up.  

Kids who are used to hiking and listen to their guardians (about not going near the edge) will enjoy the hike.  We've had 8-10 year olds out a few times and I've seen dogs a couple times.  I would not recommend dogs without protective booties though on their feet.  They'd get torn up :(

Be careful of the cactus and sharp bushes -- bring gloves just in case you take a slight tumble.  I've seen many people pulling 2 inch thorns out of their hands here.  Watch your step, drink plenty of water and enjoy the view.

Red Rock has roughly 12 other peaks in the park on the scenic loop which are not marked trails by the park though they are well established by the hiking community.  Check out Juniper Peak, Rainbow Peak, Bridge Mountain, or if you are feeling adventurous White Pinnacle Peak.  Juniper is my favorite for a good 3-4 hour hike!",1
"""This is a great place for ice cream and a general fantastic place for lunch.  They have some pretty good sandwiches and salads if you are in the mood for lunch.  But the sandwiches are kind of small.  The place also has a bunch of the ""Family Circus"" cartoons on the wall and write in the Sugar Bowl into the cartoons.  It's interesting.  They have sundaes, cones, banana splits, and their own original concoctions.  It's a great place for some dessert or for a whole meal.  There was a lot of pink though and I just wasn't feeling that.""",1
"Upgraded version of Roberto's. Same menu, taste and price but better service and quality. Roberto's has recently changed their size for shrimp cocktail from 32oz to 22oz (med drink size) which is a lot less than satisfying especially for shrimp cocktail lovers. I'd prefer Frausto's over Roberto's. The service again is a lot more pleasant.",1
"Any place that has jars of candies lined along the ceiling is your first clue that I'll love it. Second clue? The fact that ALL they serve is dessert. 

This Marble Slab Creamery is tucked away in the corner at the food court inside Market Mall. It's hard to miss however because when you step into the vicinity, all you can smell is the sweet scent of waffle cones. And considering you can smell THAT in the middle of a food court - that's pretty damn good!

Their ice cream is made daily in-store and they definitely hold true to their slogan: ""The Freshest Ice Cream On Earth"".

Marble Slab has an insane amount of flavours. Everything from Vanilla Cinnamon to Cotton Candy. And of course to celebrate the holidays, they also have Egg Nog and Pumpkin Flavours. Oh, and did I mention that you get to choose mixins?!?!? So not ONLY do you get to pick the flavour of ice cream you want, but you get to pick the mixins you want mixed in. We're talkin anything from chocolate bar pieces, to fresh fruit. So it's basically like a blizzard or a Yogen Fruz but in a cone, and with the freshest, most delicious ice cream you can imagine. Once you've picked your ice cream flavour and your mixins, they mash everything up right in front of you on a frozen counter. Then once it's all perfectly mixed, they scoop it into a cone (or a cup of you prefer) and you're good to go.

I haven't even mentioned yet that they also sell cakes, take-home pints, shakes, floats, smoothies and frozen yogurt.

I know, RIGHT?!?!??!

If you hadn't guessed it already, I'm definitely a fan. In fact, it's 'Ice Cream Break' time! See ya there!",1
"Good stuff. Prepped raw food delivered to your table where you cook your own to your preference. Pricing is a la  carte or purchase in groups of 2,4, or 6 people. Quality ingredients, included free sides. Amazing. We will be back.",1
"One of my favorite taco spots in North Carolina! The restaurant I nestled in a nice neighborhood on N Davidson Street. The service was excellent with our waitress being very attentive, especially for lunch hour during a work day. We ordered the crab dip as an appetizer and it was really good and came with so many toasted pitas we couldn't even finish it. We ordered a honey soy glazed salmon taco and a bbq mahi mahi taco. Some of the best tacos I have had! The sauce was nicely drizzled and the portion was perfect. The tacos also came with sides of avocado salad and chickpeas which complimented the main dishes well. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Charlotte area!",1
Best salon in the city. Been going to Vidal for almost a decade now. Karen is the best stylist I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. Patrice is a talented colorist who brings my hair dreams to life.,1
"We usually stop at Juniper Grill in Peters Township. Very glad we decided to go here today. I really enjoyed the rotisserie chicken tortilla soup as a starter but the special of the day was really spectacular. It was scallops over rice with a delicious lobster sauce and a very interesting coleslaw.
My wife is enjoying the shrimp and crab enchiladas also.",1
"I must have walked by this place a thousand times working on the square. Never knew what it was exactly. Came up in a search of ""Asian "" ? Amway, saw the reviews and walked over. The buffalo paninis with a side of black bean and corn salsa was very good. At $7 the price was fair, I think the yelp menu may be outdated. The desert case looked great and they have breakfast items also. There was a gift area too. Cool place and I'm far from vegan.",1
"It's pretty difficult to find good pizza in Las Vegas. It's even more difficult to please 2 east coast people that know their pizza. So when my husband and I say that this is good stuff, we really mean it. 

We love the to-go window where you can order by the slice and even an entire pie. Let's be honest, it's the perfect stop after a night of drinking.",1
Not sure why the poor reviews on the food? The food was excellent. We got the GIANT soft pretzel and beer cheese to start- AMAZING! For our meals we had the veal schnitzel and corned beef reuben. Both were phenomenal. It's a fun and very loud atmosphere. Prices are on the higher side. Want to check this place out again.,1
"South Point is a very nice hotel and everything is nice since it is only 6 years old.  The room is very clean, big and comfortable with a big flat screen TV.  Everything is modern and new.  Inside the hotel, there is a movie theater and bowling center.   The buffet is very cheap and they gave out a lot of coupons like a free cocktail, a free sovenior at gift shop, 50% coupon for Garden buffet.  It is a very nice hotel.",1
"My son has just chided me for never writing a good review. So that I become more credible, let me state that the dinner I had last night at the Ocean Club was fantastic.

My waiter, Michael was very entertaining and attentive. 

The tuna tartare appetizer was very large and it was very high quality.

The Boston chowder was good, i take off a point for too much bacon and not enough clams.

The Mediterranean Bronzino was perfectly prepared and totally delicious.

I tried some of their famous butter cake, it was as a good of a desert that I have ever tried, just too full to eat much of it.

If you are in Scottsdale, don't miss this place.",1
"We went for a Monday night happy hour just to check the place out without hoards of people around.  It's a beautiful set-up - classy, comfortable furniture, pool with cabanas for rent as well as plenty of free seating with lounge chairs and pool tables inside.  We had 3 appetizers and loved them all (shrimp ceviche, carnitas tacos and chicken quesadilla) - quality and quantity were great for happy hour food.  Drinks were just ok - they were 2 for 1 and filled up to the rim with ice.  

It's built as a party place for sure, but early in the week could be a nice atmosphere to relax poolside during Happy Hour!",1
"Whether you call it Shannxi Biang Biang or House of Egg Roll, the idea of new regional Chinese food is exciting. China is a huge country and as a Millennial I'm all about trying new places and things. I've read Fuchsia Dunlop. Of course, none of that goes very far towards helping me understand what I've eaten from a cultural perspective: the Shaanxi sandwich tasted great and it's hard to go wrong with the Shananxi-style handmade noodles. I liked how the dish veered more towards vinegar. It's something I wish I knew more about, but in the meantime I like the idea of this very specific Chinese restaurant offering something that's difficult to find anywhere else.",1
"It's interesting how a neighborhood family own restaurant can succeed, specially being in the top of the hoods. I guess good food, nice decor and great service builds regulars. 

I had the uncle Louie salad which was good, nice serving and with a lot of flavor. 

The penne wild mushroom was super good.

A nice touch is that the owners (I assume they were the owners) talked to us a couple of times. Not the typical annoying manager/owner who engages into an endless conversation but a gentle genuine courtesy chat.

All in all a very nice place.",1
"Ultimately, I'd eat here again. Minus one star due to the slightly confusing setup for ordering/service. It was our first time visiting. The deal is that you are greeted by a host/ess, sent to order at the counter where you don't pay, then sent to an assigned table to wait for your food and be waited upon by a server. You pay your tab at the table.  I feel like we were unintentionally rushed through the whole process of ordering and dining even though it wasn't busy. 

The Magic Shroom Burger was divine. I'm actually not a huge fan of mushrooms, but I was sold on the goat cheese and pesto. I think the tomato on the burger was even salted, which is an amazing touch if that small thing were actually thought about when crafting a burger.

The Green Chili Queso fries were top notch, although the fries could have been salted a little more heavily. 

The Nutella Chocolate Pretzel shake was ho hum. I didn't taste any Nutella. Hmpf!

I'll make a return trip. Yep!",1
"Great cup of coffee! Love the atmosphere! I ordered the Hex pour over..outstanding! Knowledgeable and friendly baristas. Unfortunately I couldn't tip on my card, but I'll be sure to bring cash next time!",1
Great place!! The guacamole is made fresh and tastes delicious! Love the atmosphere. Glad this place opened up in the Old Port. Brings a wind of fresh air to the restaurant scene. Would definitely recommend.,1
"after having tried almost all the Asian bakeries in that area, I think that this is the best one. Cashiers are nicer than at the other places around, there are lots of people coming there and thus everything is always super fresh.

that being said, let me now eat one of those I bought and is left in the bag... yeahhh!",1
This Kirkland employees are nice. I got a gift but didn't like it. Went to return it n it was past 30 days but I had the receipt. They were nice to give me a card for the return amount!,1
"Great quality coffee, and they have delicious lunch options. The atmosphere is nice; soft music, new artwork every month or so and pretty plants. As an added bonus they almost always have free samples of their very tasty pastries/cookies/bars!",1
"Best restaurant in Pittsburgh!!!

But really, I don't think I've ever craved anything as much as I crave Waffallonia. The waffles are warm and cripsy on the outside, and ridiculously soft and fluffy on the inside. If I'm going all out, I'll get the Waffallonia with bananas, strawberries, and the Speculoos icecream (just get it). I prefer to share it with someone since it's a pretty big portion. 

The plain waffle is also amazing and I'd recommend that too!! Basically this place is the best and I would eat this every day if it didn't have calories",1
"Great food and service! We ordered the shrimp appetizer and got the pretzels on a kitchen error as well. Both were incredible!

Dinner was the burger and beet salad for us. Pro tip: get the burger with bacon, avocado, and a friend egg. Extremely satisfying and filling.

Drinks and food came out quick and the service was great. Anthony checked in with us just the right amount and was quick to get us what we needed.

A great place to stop when downtown - close to the stadiums if going to a game or concert.",1
"I ordered a bang bang shrimp and soft shell crab and those are wonderful!! Love it. Little suggestion, should have some noodle with a bang bang shrimp. It would be awesome.",1
Angelia`s Pizza is a very solid go-to pie at a pretty reasonable price. Try some of the specialty pizzas you cannot go wrong! It would be nice to have a dining room to sit down and eat after the Moon games and practices!  We will continue to enjoy your pizza!,1
"This is THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER EATEN !!!!  Amazingly fast, friendly delivery of the most amazing pizza EVER !!!  There is no other pizza joint for me.  Ahwatukee rocks!!!",1
"New owners and did a little reno to make it more of a clean brighter look.

The sign noted it was a Japanese, Korean and China restaurant.
When we were seated... we were handed the Japanese/ China menu.
We came for Korean... the previously great portion and great tasking black bean noodles.
When we were abbout to leave and stated we were specifically here for korean... there was another menu which wss not presented... as the waiter thought we wouldnt understand it.
Nonetheless, we were happy to see our dish was available.
The portion was larger than previous owners and it tasted great!
Price was bang on too!
Very happy with the dish!

Their tempura app was a bit pricey bit the veggie pieces were big so we couldnt complain.
It was ok tasting.

Small dining area... but we had no issues getting seated.

Their main menu was very hard to read... with pages like light pink background off white fonts... they need to make their menu more legible.  Prices for sushi items very a bit on the higher side too.

Owners of this place are Chinese.",1
I've been going here for about 4 or 5 months and I love it. I go to Holly or Valarie. They treat you very well and get you out fast. They even offer you drinks while you wait. I spend about 45 dollars every time and I get the acrylic stiletto nails.,1
"Food was amazing & infusion cocktails were unique & wife wanted to try them all..
Parking was a but awkward but I think that was cause of construction..
 
For opening night the service & food were amazing only can imagine it getting better.. 

We will be back.. Maybe this weekend!",1
"I had always heard that Bobby Flay was one of the few celebrity chefs whose restaurants didn't suck.

i guess I set my expectations a little too high, as I got the breakfast enchilada and while it was very good, it wasn't amazing.

Several of my friends' dishes though, like the lamb cobb salad (!!!) looked and tasted amazing. I also liked the non-traditional basket of assorted savory and sweet breads for the table.

I should have ordered the burger....",1
"Love it. Owners are from West Babylon, NY. They had a pizza shop and Italian bakery in Islip Terrace NY right down the street from where I grew up. I could not believe they lived here for so long and I was unaware. Garlic Knots are great and the pizza is good NY style. The family were all in tonight and visited our table when they heard we were from East Islip. Uncle Joe is such a nice man. The entire evening was just delightful. I am happy to discover this little gem of a place and I will be back. Happy to say they opened a Beall's outlet right next door too so I can shop and eat. Well, at least until they move to their new location.",1
"Their yogurt is some of the best in town! They offer a variety of awesome flavors, all of which taste great. The yogurt has a really good creamy texture too. Yum.
Unlike some other yogurt places, they don't limit the number of those cute little sample cups, which is awesome. I know its a minor detail, but it really does matter!!! After sampling a few, I went with the Irish Mint. It was so good!

My only complaint, and I can see past this, is their topping setup was a little messy. Some of the bins I wanted to use were empty. Usually froyo places are on top of this. 

Anyway, this place is bomb!",1
"I love a gourmet burger and this place has a fabulous burger: great quality meat, sharp cheddar cheese, crispy bacon and on a toasted pretzel roll.  I substituted fries for Brussels spouts and they were delicious. They have an expansive list of local beers on draft, with representation from many of Charlotte's local breweries.  I'd pass on the beer cheese soup next time; it wasn't very flavorful or creamy.",1
I haven't been here in a number of years.  But I will say that the food is always good and service is great.,1
"Scott was the best server/waiter  ever, he was very nice and consist And he also helped  me pick my drink, food, dessert . Best customer service ever!!! I absolutely love this place. Awesome food and drinks.   I wish there was one in Los Angeles, but I will definitely come back.",1
"Belle petite patisserie . Les beignes au prunes sont succulentes . Le service est tr√®s courtois et ils ont tous un accent polonais ce qui contribue au charme . Les salades sont tr√®s bonne , sp√©cialement la salade russe . Par contre , l'endroit est petit et j'ai trouv√© les sandwiches pas vraiment originales.",1
"Omg I LOVE this place and the owners. Peter and Paulina are thoughtful, fun and I trust their judgement because they know my style. I'll be moving back to Montreal but I genuinely think I'll make the trip back to Toronto every two years to see them and their great options :) thanks guys!!",1
"Great experience, great service, delicious food. Our server Alec was great and very attentive. I'll be going back when in town.",1
"With all my favorite places in SouthEnd disappearing, I welcome an ABC store that I can walk to.

This location isn't the largest store, but it should have what you need.

Lots of windows seem to let a lot of light in and all the liquors are organized by type.  Large NC local selection of spirits here.

Convenient parking lot, but also super walkable from the light rail and all the apartments that are being built all around SouthEnd",1
Friendly service and delicious breads! My husband has to have the banana bread every day and my daughter is addicted to the sricha rolls. This is a hidden gem.,1
Very good service and quality! Clean place. Love it! Will be back for sure. Everything was prepared and made well.,1
"This is my go to lunch spot near work. The sandwiches and soups never disappoint. Definitely worth going out of your way for!

P.S. They also make some solid breakfast burritos if you get there before 11.",1
"I really enjoyed this place. I'd give the decor 4.5 stars and the service and food 5 stars. Our waiter was super nice and he seemed to really love his job. My family got 1 lb of shrimp ""hot feel"" and mild. The sauce is good! The shrimp are big too. We also got 2 free pounds of combination seafood because of a newspaper special they have. The lamb skewers were bombbb! The location is kind of tucked into the plaza across Tea Station.",1
"If you love yourself, and you should, get the fresh mozzarella. 

If you don't live yourself, get the fresh mozzarella and learn what true love is.

Fresh ingredients, fun ambiance, amazingly friendly and fun servers, you can't miss. I'm partial to the fresh pasta, signature non alcoholic drinks, and the charity bread.",1
"Stop by after church on the way home. Truthfully never noticed this place. It doesn't look inviting from the outside (don't judge a book by it's cover). The wait was really long, yes it was lunch time. I wanted breakfast and if you follow me you know I love my french toast. Yup they we're yummy! Our waitress Alexia was amazing, sweet, helpful, and patient. Why patient? I ordered, cancelled, and ordered again. Why? Had a emergency call had to leave, emergency was resolved within 10 min. Thanks Alexis for understanding. Food good, service good, decor could use a little update. Check this place out!",1
"Delicious burgers for sure! Add that with the Cajun fries and it makes the meal even better!

The free peanuts is a nice touch.

I'd give it 4.5 but the app doesn't let it. I'd deduct the half star just for the price. We got a 2 burgers (reg and little) with med fries and large drink cost me $25.

Best burger joint in the area.",1
"I chose La Quinta over other pet friendly hotels because they don't charge an extra fee for them, and I had two little doggies!! So, plus, plus there!! Room rates very reasonable.  Room had no lingering smells of any sort, very clean.  Location for my needs, right on! Had complimentary breakfast, yum!  And free wifi.  So, really saved on a lot.  Staff was friendly.  Will recommend to others especially if travelling with pets!!

Only 4 stars because the only night I had a chance to relax and enjoy pool, the pool was temporarily closed down til the next day when I check out! Boo!!!",1
"Excellent coffee shop and very conveniently located to pop in and go or sit for a bit with your coffee outside. All of the drinks are amazing, I have been 3 times, today will be 4 and each time I want to get another. All of the employees are so nice and they are quick to get you your drink. They also have waffles, I haven't personally tried one but I have seen a couple people order them and I always want it! Definitely give this place a shot, personal favorite is the iced vanilla latte which on the menu is probably named after a bird.",1
"Got t-boned by a texter-and-driver on a weekend; a Halblieb's truck showed up at the scene first and towed me to the shop. I was originally planning to have my car fixed with another shop that I have used in the past, but man am I glad I gave Halblieb's a chance. Don't let the atmosphere or Scotch Bottom location sketch you out. They had serious damage fixed in less than two weeks, detailed my car to a level of cleanliness it hasn't seen since I drove it off the lot, and gave me a certificate for a free inspection (or detailing, customer's discretion) any time in the next year (which I will definitely be using). They do in-house rentals, which cost me nothing beyond what the insurance covers. Can't say the same for Hertz or Enterprise. 

Halblieb's goes out of their way to save the customer money. Also, if you're not from Pittsburgh and you want to encounter a prime example of the fast-disappearing yinzer, workaholic culture, make sure you meet John while you're there.",1
"Thank goodness for this place. I did not pack a dress, and it would have cost an arm and leg elsewhere in Vegas. I bought shoes and a dress for around $70. The shoes were a mess, the clothes were a mess, but with that many tourists having their first Ross experience.... It was kind of clean when you think of it that way. There were some rude international folks that feel like they have to fight you for bargains, i.e. grab items that were in front of you... so be prepared for that! Its pretty busy in there every time I go, and the line is also long, but worth it to save some money. They usually have a good amount of cashiers working. Some of the staff is really nice, others are not. Some are just terrible. There was this one lady putting a basket of sunglasses on the rack. A customer next to me, reached across me to grab into the basket. The employee told her she couldn't do that and that she would have to wait for her to set them on the rack. Which I understand, because the glasses would be all over the floor if the customer went diving into them. The funny part ....as the employee was filling the rack, she took her time and spun the freshly placed sunglasses towards the wall, away from that lady. The customer looked SO mad. I kind of smiled at her while we waited and she glared back at me. It was a funny situation, and I don't blame the employee for doing that but its not the best customer service you get there. Overall I was happy with my experience and purchase there and definitely would return.",1
This ended up being a second choice because the first choice was closed. I was not disappointed. They have excellent food and great decor. It can get loud at times but the food is amazing. They are also good for vegetarians and the portions are large. Their guacamole was excellent. They bring over a bottle filled with water and it's not tap water which I really appreciate. Definitely recommend.,1
Finally! A place for good tacos! I'm from southern CA and love Baja style tacos and finally found some here in AZ. Homemade refried beans were yummy too and good rice! I had a prickly pear margarita with my meal which was a bonus. It's in a strip mall and it feels fast-foody (you order at the counter) but I didn't mind that. Will definitely be back when I want Mexican food.,1
"I used this company in 2011 to paint my entire house inside and out and was absolutely pleased with the men and the work done. In 2014, I had moved and needed some painting done in the new house. The work wasn't done very well, walls weren't completely painted, and a lot of paint splatters were left in the rooms. These were a different group of painters, not any of the ones we had on the first project. Today, an appointment was made by the office personnel to meet my husband at a specific time for another estimate. My husband left work early, to make the appointment time, and Mike never showed up, called, or contacted us in any way. Question: has this company gotten so big, they no longer care about their customers, and repeat customers at that?

The above proved to be a miscommunication. Crash of Rhinos owner has resolved the problem, and has gone above and beyond to provide the excellent service he has always been known for.",1
"My dad and I went to deluca's for breakfast while we were in Pittsburgh. We had heard that deluca's was very good, we also heard that it was always hard to get a seat. When we got there the line was just coming outside the door a little so we didn't expect much of a wait, but when we got there their was no wait. We were seated almost immediately at the front counter. I got the banana split hot cakes while my dad had the Pittsburg slam. My food was delicious, my dad also enjoyed his meal. The only thing that I could see as a problem is that a party of 3 or more would have to wait a while for seating.",1
"We're big fans of Bobby Flay, but hadn't been to a restaurant, and Mesa didn't disappoint! We had some delicious drinks, and the bread was varied, plentiful, and flavorful. We had the queso fundido to start, and it was SO good - best I've ever had. The diverse and complimentary flavors were the biggest theme throughout - everything perfectly worked and was so interesting. We also had the pork tenderloins and the chile relleno. Both were incredible, and the relleno was my favorite. It's very mushroom-forward, which I loved, but my husband didn't like as much. Finally, we ended with the pecan bourbon tart, which went well with the refreshing sour cream ice cream. The service was also very good, and the decor is cool. They were also able to seat us early, which was nice. Definitely one of the best southwestern meals I've had, and Bobby Flay's food lives up to the hype!",1
"I love this place! 

I have been four times now and it is fresh, consistent and reasonable. I usually get the Spicy maki-combo and a wakame salad.  Plus, the owners are so very cheerful! 

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I would like to sit in and eat, and save on so much packaging.",1
"The woman at the reception desk was friendly and she sent me to another waiting area. The gentleman who checked me in was also pleasant and effective.

I did have to wait over an hour after the time they told me to arrive. They said to arrive at 10:30am for my 11:00am appointment. They saw me shortly before noon.

The nursing and medical staff were professional and my experience was excellent.",1
Im so glad I found this place. My husband and I come here. Dr Clark and her staff are so nice. The receptionist is very helpful and you don't have to wait too long . Thanks for everything vision center.,1
Awesome work great prices!  Very professional and delivered as promised.   I will be bringing all my cars here in the future.,1
"Best pho place in Vegas!! Hands down! I have been to many places and this is such a small cute place, they have so many options and the prices are prefect for what you get!!!",1
My family and I have been coming to elixir for dinner and drinks since they opened. The atmosphere is amazing and the staff is so personable! We love coming in and seeing Coleen her smile and charisma is infectious! You can't go wrong with the food. Hint: have the stuffed mushrooms they will change your life!!! They have a great Sunday brunch. That is mine and my husbands go to during football season.,1
"I found this on Yelp, and love the food here so much that even though it's off the beaten track for me, I often try to bail off the 401 while on roadtrips just to go eat here.

I'm vegetarian, and their veggie wrap, for the money, is one of the best.  There is also a pretty fabulous potato bread (bolani), which, although you have to call ahead if you want it to arrive while you are eating the rest of your food, is wonderful.

They also do a good job of managing rushes by pre-prepping trays etc., but because a lot 
 of the food is prepped when you order it, expect a bit of a wait.",1
"Finally made my visit to Tacos Huicho as my ongoing trek for the best tacos in Arizona continues. Read good reviews by fellow yelpers of this place. I believe they just renovated the dining area as I did not see the broken chairs, sticky tiles, nor limited seating that some yelpers experienced. I was introduced to laminate flooring, new chairs, and fresh smell of paint. Also the fact that they were repairing the bathrooms during business hours was quite frank as you can hear the workers drilling away (it was really loud, quick tip may want to compete repairs before or after business hours). Now to the tacos, they were above average at best as nothing spectacular about it: cabeza, pastor, longaniza, and tripa. There was no salsa bar described by others but bottles of there salsa itself. I gave it an extra star as the price cannot be beat, $1.10 for the three tacos for tacos Tuesday special and $1.50 for the tripa taco! I believe all tacos are $1.50 on a regular day. Total paid was $4.90 for four tacos, which is unheard of nowadays as most tacos shops charge at least $2 per taco. You get more variety here and bang for your buck. Though it won't hit my top 10 tacos shops here in AZ, it definitely lands within the Top 20. I shall come back again and try the rest of their listed tacos!",1
"Just came here for the first time. Some cool things that set it apart from say, Jason's Deli: Italian soda bar, charging station, chocolate dipped strawberry with every meal. Grilled cheese sandwich was really good, as were the tomato bisque and red pepper lobster soups. Really reasonably priced. 
The bad: Caramel brownie looked better than it tasted. My boyfriend's soup had a hair in it. Limited seating. Loud.",1
A nice spot to get some Vietnamese food. I had the house soup and it was quite good. The owner and staff are very friendly and inviting.,1
"This restaurant is a GEM!  Service was spectacular and the food was terrific. Based on Yelp review, I ordered the Traditional Greek Salad.  Absolutely fantastic - light dressing, HUGE size and totally delicious.  I strongly suggest going when they have their live entertainment.  Beyond my expectations.  We were treated like valued guests.  Try the spanokopita - it's delicious.   Belly dancing and live music with incredible singers.  What a delight.",1
"I never thought an animal clinic would earn the holy grail of star ratings, but Dr. Bob at Gateway is truly that good. 

Don't get me wrong. I've been taking my short dog there for a little over a year now and have had good experiences with all the docs. That said, Dr. Bob is the best vet I've ever had the furry occasion to work with. 

He not only tends to my (often scared and sometimes grumpy) little dog. He also makes sure I understand everything he's doing to my (often scared and sometimes grumpy) little dog and why. In short, I always know what's going on with her and how to best care for her. 

In that, Dr. Bob is not just wonderful to the critters he treats. He's also wonderful to the humans who love them.",1
"While I am not in love with Wildflower, I do have to mention the great service we had recently. We have food allergies, so we are ""those people"" when we place an order. CarolAnne was very patient and friendly with us AND she got our order entered correctly on the first try! It sounds funny but that doesn't happen very often. We told the manager how sweet she was and she was happy to hear that as this is CarolAnn's first job. Keep up the friendly service CarolAnne! I also noticed new management at this location, which was much needed.",1
"Coming from California, a land of a huge variety of authentic Asian cuisine, I wasn't expecting much of a Thai restaurant in this area. 
But I was proven wrong.
They make some awesome curry! The menu looks great; real good variety of dishes.
Overall, very impressed. And since I am now living in the area will definitely keep them in mind when I feel like eating some Thai food.",1
"Had an appointment for an eye checkup and to get my first pair of glasses in over a decade, and they couldn't have really made it more painless.  Dr. Jordan was professional, knowledgable, and most importantly - personable.  They got me in quick with no hassle and I didn't have to wait very long at all.  Jen was great in helping me select and set up the frames that fit my needs!  

I look forward to continuing to go to them for all my future optical needs, barring that I don't wake up one day with super vision :-)",1
"I spend just about every day here, and I love it. The food is always amazing, you can hang out there all day on your laptop, and it's great for meeting friends.",1
"This is an amazing brick and mortar store.  There is nothing fancy, but the essentials are all there if you just take a few minutes to browse with the helpful staff.

Becoming a new puppy owner is no joke and requires a lot of attention to detail.  Surprisingly enough, this store has competitive prices compared to our online research, plus they have a loyalty program.  With these awesome prices, it's encouraging to support local stores.

Bring your furry friend, because they love to snap pictures of them.  The evidence is all around the walls.  The staff offered some samples of the Taste of the Wild dog food and I was thrilled that I didn't have to buy a large quantity just to see if the pup's stomach could handle the variety like salmon, lamb, etc.  I've also heard they have a return guarantee on their food, but I rather not buy massive quantities to save a few bucks and waste food.

Food, treats and toys are well represented here, but not so much on the supplies.  I'm totally okay with that, because the store can only carry so much items.  I rather have fresh food for our fur-puppy.",1
"Great gyro and priced fair. Not as big as the messini gyros but definitely nice to have this place in the west end. Good service and good food. Give it a try.

I highly recommend.",1
"This place allows you to sample before you purchase, so that was very nice as I was trying to decide between peanut butter or coconut. Both were delicious, but I was craving peanut butter. The toppings were standard for most froyo places, but I was a little disappointed that they didn't have chocolate covered pretzels or yogurt pieces. I saw a lychee flavor which I thought was really cool. Perhaps I shall get that next time. The other flavors I could remember were blueberry (no sugar added), red velvet,  and vanilla. There were at least a few more.

The seating and decor is cute.",1
"Terrible experience. Cheap feel, room smelled like cigarette smoke. When we approached the staff about this, they were rude and didn't offer to remedy the situation. Overpriced. 

I enjoyed my stay at the Golden Nugget much more than this ""luxury"" hotel.",0
Be advised they only have one high chair and one booster seat. If you have multiple babies or toddlers you may want to go somewhere else.,0
"Overpriced Chinese food.  Not really the quality I expected from a place inside the Caesar Palace.   The food is pretty much tasteless.  Great ambiance unfortunately, that is what you are paying for. My advice, try something else. Great if you never had good Chinese before.  I have had Chine fast food that tastes better then this.",0
"SCAM....SCAM...ALERT... I took my van in on 2 March 16 and I had 29,700 miles.  My battery was dying so I made an appointment at 5 to have it checked out.  After a little over an hour Keith called me and stated that, yes my battery failed and that it was replaced under warranty.  I am like cool but then he showed me the multi point inspection sheet that my front brakes were at 3 and 2 mm and my rear brakes were at 7mm.  He said it would cost 329.00 to replace the front brakes but I had my kids so I told him I couldn't at that time but will comeback in a few days.  So I left and went home and told the wife the outcome.  She then stated "" weren't the brakes at 8 or 7 the last time it was there?  I was like yea your right, so I went and took out the invoice and looked on the inspection sheet and yes it stated my front brakes were at 7mm(Green) and rear at 5mm(Yellow).  That was on 18 Jan 16 and my mileage was at 28,500. So within a month and half, 1,200 miles later my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and rear brakes went from 5mm back to 7mm.  WOW...I bought this van in Las Vegas in May of 2014.  We moved in June of 2015 to Pennsylvania and drove the van.  So from May 2014 to Jan 2016 and 5 to 28,500 miles my front brakes went from 10mm to 7mm and rear brakes went from 10mm to 5mm which sounds about right.  So doing the math, that's the front brakes losing 3mm and rear brakes losing 5mm.  Now from 18 Jan 16 to 2 Mar 16 and 28,500 to 29,700 miles my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and my rear brakes went from 5mm to 7mm, so again doing the math my front brakes lost 5mm and rear brakes gained 2mm.  So just under 2 years I lost 3mm, then under 1.5 months I lost 5mm...I don't think so.  They obviously tried to scam me into getting front brakes when I don't really need them and I would have got them if it wasn't for my kids being with me at the time.  Either the techs don't know what they are doing or this is a scam...I bet on that it is a scam...stay away from them....",0
"Unfortunately, for all the food is pretty good, the service is terrible. We've given this a good couple tries now and don't think we will be coming back. Our food order is incorrect more often than not, they advertise some food that I have yet to see available, and despite closing in the middle of the day to clean and restock ... they seem to use an awful lot of pre-packaged vegetables, can't quite keep things in stock, and don't appear to have the time to train employees on ingredients to answer questions when asked or, especially after our last experience just tonight, on customer service either. 

A lot of people seem to love it here, and regretfully ... I cannot figure out why.",0
"Many people who reviewed that place say that they have been in California or Texas, that they know what good burritos taste like, etc. Well, I have also lived on the West Coast, been to CA and TX, and I was quite disappointed with this burrito place. I won't say I was surprised, because we live in Montreal and it's so hard to find good Mexican or Tex Mex food around here. But the service was slow, and I was not impressed with the food. For example, the fillings were not evenly placed in the burrito, so there were bites with just rice, nothing else. Don't waste your time and money there.",0
I'm sitting here still at the vig waiting for about 20 minutes while our waitress Sierra  chit chats away with the host Instead of  checking us out. This has absolutely been the worst experience I've ever had. I usually go to the downtown vig but decided to come to this location since it's closer. Boy do I regret this so much. She didn't take our kids drinks orders and walked off in the middle of me trying to place my order which was extremely rude. All of our drinks remained empty for most of our meals. This will be my last time coming.,0
"I had explicitly explained to your manager that 1) I didn't receive an email - so I didn't see this fine print that you speak of; 2) I'm in the process of relocation, so I don't have my license transferred to NV and still work in both NV and CA.

Maybe the reason you boast not being a crowded gym is that you won't let anyone use your facility without these crazy conditions that I and others speak of in reviews...

Additionally, you have one shower stall with a huge rainfall shower head; not everyone wants to have water falling directly on their head and no where else...

Anyway, thank you to the GM for being such a jerk; this allowed for me to see that there is no flexibility whenever there is an issue that may arise with your patrons. The reason I signed with 24? Their staff was understanding of my situation and totally accommodating.  Yay for them - love them!!!",0
"After visiting the real Richmond Hill Corporate run Nando's, I was surprised at how bad the service is at Markham Road. I have visited  this location a few times and have always left with a bad experience and never went back! 

The staff never smile or try to engage in conversation with you and in comparison to the real Nando's at Richmond Hill- this seems like a fake version. The chicken is not as flavourful and the portions are very small. Save your experience and try Richmond Hill for a real Nando's  experience!",0
"The food here is amazing, but the service is absolutely terrible. I've been here 3 times and every time I hope that the service will be better but it never is. Takes about 10 minutes just to order drinks and another 10 to order food unless you flag down your waiter. My friend and I both ordered the same thing and her food came out 15 min ahead of mine. My sister ordered a deep fried sushi roll and when it came out she noticed it wasn't fried at all. When she asked the waiter he stated that they changed how they cooked the roll but haven't updated the menu. We finished eating and sat for an extra 30 just waiting for the bill. Currently I'm still waiting for our bill. The couple next to us has been seating for at least 20 min and nobody has been by to ask them what they want to drink. HIRE MORE PEOPLE.",0
"I only go every now and then because it's close. The servers are high-strung and not friendly. One or two of them will ask ""how's everything?"" but boy there's this one server that has awful service. The sashimi is nothing compared to Zipang or Roku but their ramen is delicious!",0
"I had a 1/2 chicken dinner with fries and BBQ sauce. $14 + tax.
The seasoning on the chicken skin was delicious, but my chicken was noticeably dry and chewy. I imagine it had been sitting there for a while.

The BBQ sauce was good; the fries were mediocre. The service wasn't exactly rude, but definitely not friendly.

I know they make a big deal about their food quality, but there is a lot of room for improvement. I probably won't go back.",0
Worst Thai food I've ever had I ordered scallop asparagus and shiitake I couldn't have more than 2 bites... It was tasteless and after I had the first bite there was a paste of oil on the top of the inside of my mouth it was so gross!! Also the scallops were like rubber so chewy!!.. I also ordered basil noodle with beef it had no flavor the only thing that was decent was the BBQ chicken from the grilled section... And I asked to get some peanut sauce for it which I didn't get.... I'm never coming back!!,0
"My order got here earlier than expected but the toppings, cheese and sauce is all over the box. Now the crust is soggy. I hate being that person but now I have to call for a new pizza.",0
"Not recommended. I booked and was told I would be picked up at my hotel and taken to a ticketing office and there would receive tickets for the USBR 1 hr tour of Hoover Dam for $132. Instead after  paying they gave me a different tour, NO offer of a full refund. I did not receive the Hoover dam tickets. When I called I was told I booked with their agency so they were not responsible for not providing what I paid for. The booking agency said they weren't responsible either. After over a month of back and forth including talking to managers for Airbridge and Best Tours I was given $33 back as ""FULL"" compensation. I paid $132. The face value of the tickets I did not receive alone was $90 so definitely not a happy customer. I was even less satisfied when I complained and $33 not even being the cost of the tickets I did not receive and still being out $99 and having never received the tour learning that the Airbridge Manager and Best Tour manager had talked and it was decided ""You have been compensated"" ""You got exactly what you wanted.""

If I were to go again, which I will be to actually see the dam, I am renting a car and avoiding the bus tour. The bus ""tour"" was about an hour and a half driving behind motels and hotels, did not include fund Hoover Dam facts on route, and did not include Hoover Dam tour tickets which in the advertisement were included. Instead it was a $132 bus ride to walk outside the dam and see the visitor center. Definitely not worth it.",0
"They treat patients like an ATM. 

I cracked a tooth. EXTREME pain right now. Got a Saturday ( today visit). I told the front desk BEFORE I went back that I didn't get paid until Wednesday ( a few days), and that I just paid to fix my roof so money is tight. After being examined and X rayed they explained what they could do and that my portion would be $160. They weren't sure they could even help m today as Phan's schedule was tight. I told them I could only pay $100 today. I was told by their office manager they don't do payment plans , they could try and get me some dental credit plan. I told them I didn't want to do that. It was $160 today or nothing. I told them I was unable to do that. So I came in pain , left in pain- they did nothing for me - I offered to pay my bill (around $60) as I left. They wanted to bill my insurance etc but I didn't want to hear from them again so I insisted I pay it all now because I wanted nothing to do with them ( contact me after insurance etc). . I complained  and to shut me up they wiped the bill clean. 

They are all about the money. My $100 today plus insurance ( and $60 in 3 business days) wasn't enough to help me. Forget about helping me because I was in pain - they did nothing - nothing - they wouldn't even do it for 2/3 my portion today , the rest in a few days ( as well as gouging my  insurance) 

THEY ARE ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. They don't care if you hurt. They are very high tech - and I understand they need to pay off all their high tech equipment - 

My opinion : Pham sucks! Palo verde dental sucks!  

Came in pain , left in pain - they use your pain to extort money from you. It's just white collar crime - they knew exactly my finances before I even went to a room , and then after exam it was ""pay up or get out"" - the officer manager specifically said ""we do not do payment plans"". 

They wasted my one day off when I could have found someone who would help me when I am in severe pain

"Growing up, I used to go here every Sunday, however stopped for 5 years and I finally made back couple of weeks ago. So, what's my thought?

I'm truly disappointed. Their dim sum wasn't fresh anymore. How would I know? 1. I inherited my parents' (my father used to be a chef) canine-like nose and taste, so I definitely know when something isn't fresh. 2. I've been to NYC and Atlanta, so if you want fresh dim sum then you have to try those places first and then tell me if Dim Sum is still good or not. 

I'm not trying to be mean, but this place isn't authentic anymore. I think due to the change in clientele that this place americanized their dim sum. 

I'm definitely will not be plan on going back for any reason. I think I'll stick with my random trips to Atlanta and get dim sum there.",0
"Too busy to focus on excellent customer service? Or is it because I'm a single sitting at the sushi bar that I'm not as important or profitable of the table of four? Tonight was the final straw for Ru Sans. My server was so neglectful and rude, the whole experience was ruined. I literally had to get up and go to the bar to get my bill because I only had seen my server once the whole time and I literally couldn't find him.  Did I want another soda? Did I want another sushi roll? Did I want dessert? Shame on you Ru Sans. After many years of coming here, I'm done.",0
"This place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.  Pizza Nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one I've ever frequented.  The pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.  Not sure why the couple who own the place refuse to put more than an ounce of sauce on the pizza, but that's what you basically get from them.  You dont even taste the sauce, that's how little they put.  The lack of sauce throws off the whole balance of what a pizza is, so all you taste is dough, cheese, and toppings.  It's more like a sandwich with no condiments than a pizza.  We didn't even bother finishing the whole thing, which is unheard of in our household, that's how bland it was.  If there was a better option in the area I wouldn't bother with this place, sadly there isn't.",0
"We love Johnny Rockets. I am not sure what goes on at this location-or if it was just an off day-but the chicken sandwich was inedible. It tasted like nuked chicken. 

The shakes were the normal quality-great shakes. Servers were very kind-would have been a one star but not for these two positives. 

Our recommendation is to pass on this location. Not a fair example of a typical Johnny Rockets quality.",0
"My two star rating of this restaurant doesn't mean that the food is not good.  Instead it is suppose to expresses my disappointment after build up in my mind about this gastropub.  I would revisit for a couple of specific dishes however I'm not one to enthusiastically  encourage anyone I know to go.

My date and I went to celebrate her birthday and experience one of East 4ths signature restaurants.  I wanted to get a complete idea of the menu so I ordered the four course chefs tasting menu while she ordered the Whole Grilled Padr√≥n Peppers and the  40 Day Dry Aged Rib Steak Frites.  Since I was driving and she was not we considered ordering a half bottle of wine until we saw the high prices of the wine, ($30+)

They first brought out my Peel & Eat Gulf Shrimp and her Whole Grilled Padr√≥n Peppers. Both were excellent although I felt it was a lot of work to peal and devein the three large, headed shrimp.  The Padr√≥n Peppers were described as 50/50 sweet and hot like a jalapeno but the ones she had while delicious were not hot.

Next they brought my Crispy Chicken Wings Confit which is one of two items that I would go back to get.  The menu said that it's served with roasted jalapeno but I couldn't find or taste any, in fact these wings didn't have any heat what so ever.

The entrees of ""40 Clove"" Heirloom Garlic Roasted  1/2 Chicken and 40 Day Dry Aged Rib Steak Frites.  Presentation was wonderful and worthy of the highest complements.  The taste on the other hand was average at best.  The chicken gives the impression that you'd get chicken roasted with 40 cloves of garlic or some other herb but other than the chicken being served inside brioche bread there was no notable garlic or herb flavor.  The steak was served as a ribeye and a separate braised rib but ended up on the fatty side.

Served with my chicken was the other reason that I'd go back, the Very Very Very Spicy Greens n' Beans.  I'm not considered a greens lover by any stretch but I love these!  The chili paste is balanced against the white beans.

Lastly we split the Cinnamon Roll Warm Bread Pudding with vanila creme anglaise.  What seemed like an excellent concept turned out to be a terrible disappointment.  The bread pudding was more like a dry bread casserole and the the creme anglaise was presented as the dreaded ""spoon push' smear.

I could go on but suffice to say if you want presentation over taste Greenhouse is your kind of choice.",0
"Terrible.

Food is just not very good and some of the dishes are very unappetizing.

Service is bad. Food takes FOREVER to come from the kitchen.

Had to leave without even receiving all of our food after 2.5hrs.",0
"I have given this place a try quite a few times during the past few years. I was just here as last resort because the other places in the area were closed on Sundays. It's not that I expect friendly service from the person working at the counter but when your place is named ""Aloha"" Kitchen, you'd think someone can crack a smile and say hi when they take your order.  It's just not one time, it's consistently like this, no greeting at all!   

The food is alright, I do give credit that they plate the food attractively, but they rely too much on drowning their meats in sauce for flavor instead of seasoning and marinating it.  The slices of beef that did have no sauce were a little dry & tasteless.  The manapua I ordered was a store bought brand and the dough was a bit tough. (like they left it cooking in the microwave a little too long) . That's probably why you get your food real quick!! It's already been prepared all they do is reheat it!  There are at least 3 other places that serve up better Hawaiian & Filipino food in the area so aloha, Aloha Kitchen.",0

"Pretty average spot. 

Italian food priced reasonably but won't really 'wow' you. I had a sausage pizza for 11$ which was a good size and cooked somewhere in between thin crust and doughy. They've got some lunch specials and salads that looked alright, although the salmon filet looked to be a frozen cut. 

Service was adequate. 

Is Baldwin street actually good?",0
"Worst Wendy's I been to. Its a very slow hr few cars in the drive tru & a couple in dinning room...

"First time here and it will definitely be my last.  Service was terrible, food was bland which was surprising because the salsa was so hot you couldn't eat it.  Only one coors light in the resturant and it was warm.  Nothing good to say about this place. Very disappointed.",0
"Never again.  Not only will I not set foot back in Bricco, but I'll never stay at the Doubletree because of the rude manager at Bricco.  I tried to complain to the desk at the hotel and was told that the individual that had spoke to us the way he did was the Manager so not to put in a complaint until the next morning.  We were locked on the Patio and knocked to be let back in...no one came...shook the door and the Manager came and opened the door.  I assumed he was letting us back in.  Instead he told us the door was locked (as he's standing in it) and that me and my fiancee can jump the fence to get back in....Seriously?!  He then shut the door and walked back in.  Yes, we're still standing on the patio locked out.  This was at about 11:30.  I jumped the fence, went the entire way around the building, back into Bricco and to the door that he just shut to let her in.  Very rude and cost them my repeat business.  This man does not need to be in a business that deals with the public...get him in an office behind a wall where he doesn't have to be bothered by paying customers.",0
"We ordered this Monday night after a busy work day. Generally a fail safe, as you know what you're going to get. Not this time. I got my own pan pizza, which saved my boyfriend who got his own pizza, from being violently ill for 3 days. Im still feeling the stomach pain, although not the terrible twisting of death i was the days before. I phoned to inform them of what happened and of course, just as i thought, the person i spoke too did not care or say anything worth anything. I explained how I didn't want anything, just that they should probably know. They proceeded to tell me that i would need to see a doctor to prove what happened. I honestly do not care nearly enough to pay $10 for a doctors note to prove this. I am just warning other people that this was by far the most painful sick i have ever been in my life. Violently awful and lasted for days now. Please beware...",0
Just like Culvers except not as good. Pricey because it's in Scottsdale. Went there for lunch on 3/29/16 got the smoked stack burger and a small shake and it was $13. Went with people from work all 4 of us had stomach issues and felt ill the rest of the day. Save yourself the trouble and go another trendy burger place in Scottsdale than this one. I can think of hundreds.,0
"Service was good,  but the food was horrible.  I'm Mexican and this was not good Mexican food at all...most of the food seemed like it came from a can and the tortillas were most likely store bought. I will never come back.",0
"So..... - they sold me a car with a bad clutch - the car only had 40k miles - took it back a couple weeks later when I started noticing it, I noticed it the first day I had it, but was like ""maybe it just delays a little, it has such low miles"" - nope - bad clutch - service told me it was going to be $160 to look at it - I talked to the salesman and finance - they blew me off like nothing - So I drove it as long as I could with a screwed up clutch - the clutch was $1200+ to fix at the dealer - I got it done at a local shop for just over $1000... #1 I and nobody I know will every buy a car from them again - #2 that is what I get for buying a foreign piece of crap - I will only buy American or Toyota (they are mostly made in the U.S. anyways) - Oh and free car washes?? - yeah if you have an hour or so to wait",0
"I want to like this place. But the service is just too bad. Wish they take a little bit more pride in the place because it's just right down the street from my house on main street. The food is hit or miss. The salmon salad I got was a huge mess! Salmon tasted old, over seasoned, super thin, just iceberg lettuce and standard grocery store dressing. Avocado was fresh and yummy though. It was nice to have chips and salsa included. The salsa was great, but overall this place is not worth the risk with Nunthaporn across the street and the great Republica Empanada just down the street on Hibbert and first Avenue.",0
"I drove to Sears Home Appliance showroom because an advertisement was placed on my front door with appliances up to 50% off. I was not in the market for an appliance, but I might be coaxed into buying sooner with prices like that. So, I decided to go there. The sales guy informed me that the flyer was wrong, and that there was only a 30% discount. When I got home I re-read the ad to see if I missed the posting for the date. Nope! False advertising. Aside from that (which is what is influencing the large majority of this rating), the staff was nice. The products looked to be of quality, and the showroom was clean.",0
"I am an Ubereats delivery driver.  I arrived at the restaurant at 2:48 pm and stood at the courier pickup counter.  There was a young lady running the register, and a manager with headset delegating tasks to the staff visible from my view point.  The manager walked past me numerous times, hyper focused on bags and monitors and never once glanced at me to make eye contact.  At no point did he even acknowledge my presence.  After 8 minutes of standing there, I finally locked on and said HEY, is the ubereats order ready yet?  

His response to me was ""You should have spoken up, I can't read your mind"".  This response is the most unprofessional and rude interaction I have ever had at any restaurant while doing deliveries.  This man has clearly no sense of customer service, and the fact that he is a supervisor, with an entire staff of employees within earshot, is a galactic worry.  This is whom they are taking their cues from.  

So, I will speak up.  Greeting customers and making eye contact with them is the very basic first steps to customer service, across all chains and brands and industries.  And customer service is the business you are in, Mr. Manager.  Your deluded belief that customers should scream at the top of their lungs to get your attention is ridiculous, especially as you've closed yourself off to all interaction by talking loudly in your headset, fidgeting with bags and monitors, and basically ignoring everything human in site.  Don't you think that would intimidate people and make them second guess approaching you?  I have the answer, and the answer is yes.  

I will never again do a food delivery at this location.  I can guarantee you I am not the only one, because often times I am pinged from 10 miles away from this restaurant to do a delivery.  Really?  There's nobody within 10 miles if this place that is willing to go there?  There is a reason!  Corporate needs to take a look at this franchise and consider revoking the license.  Read these yelp reviews very carefully.",0
"Horrible- Unclean, rancid, foul odors, unkempt, and poor service. The restaurant was nearly empty, and the cashier didn't even look up to say hello as my husband stood hungrily grinning at the counter. Needless to say, I talked him into driving up the road to the other location. This one is unacceptable.",0
"Terrible experience. Cheap feel, room smelled like cigarette smoke. When we approached the staff about this, they were rude and didn't offer to remedy the situation. Overpriced. 

I enjoyed my stay at the Golden Nugget much more than this ""luxury"" hotel.",0
"Well, after being a loyal patron since moving to Mesa, AZ in 1991, it's sad that Matta's and me will be apartin' ways. I love their food! Their food is great but my last 2 visits (1 to the Riverview location and most recently the Higley location) left me extremely disappointed due to menu changes and inflexible customer service. 

A few months ago at Riverview, I requested to make a substitution in an item that came with a new meal offering of their's that I wanted to order. My server told me it was not possible. (I'd like to note the young man was not my regular server, an awesome lady from Crotia who's terrific at her job!) The item I wanted sold a la carte for the same price as the item included in my meal. I even offered to pay a buck or two upcharge in order to get what I wanted but the server refused. I asked to speak with a manager several times but one never came to my table. I ordered something else and continued my request to speak with a manager who never came despite my server's reassurance that he would. I haven't been back since. 

Today, I stopped at the Higley location, ordered a burro with a side of sour cream and a drink. I've ordered this burro by itself numerous times over the past several years (most recently last month) but today I was told it now comes with choice of beans or rice. They could not sell me just the burro. After much insistence that I did not want either, a lady working behind the counter told cashier and me that I didn't have to take the side but they couldn't adjust the price. I thought she might offer to comp my side of sour cream or my drink in exchange; but no such luck. So, $10.69 for a burro and a drink! I just find it difficult to spend hard-earned money and either not be able to get what I want or feel taken advantage of. 

Matta's, it's been a nice run with you but I won't be coming back.",0
"First time at Chili's and probably my last... The food was okay but not amazing, definitely cheap prices. The service needs a lot of work as well as their management. Messed up our order multiple times and no apologies for it... You'd think as a manager you'd want to make sure people eating at your restaurant get great customer service... (not the case here). Also waited almost 25 minutes for our first refill when multiple servers passed by our table seeing 6+ empty glasses... Not impressed what so ever with this restaurant, SMH.",0
"Awful awful experience
Walked in expecting a fantastic dinner.  Started off with the jelly fish and it was decent so looking forward to the rest of the meal.  That's when it went downhill.  Hot and sour soup is watered down.  Bitter soup with maw fish tasted like pickle juice and broth.  Egg plant was ok.  Meat on the ribs was tender but had no flavor.  Like I opened up a bottle of la Choy Hunan sauce and poured it on the meat. Worst part was the rude server.  I tried this restaurant using a groupon and she kept telling everybody at the table how I only paid 50$ for $80 of food.  She said this three times extremely loudly.  Purpose of the promotion is to get people to come back.  I called manger afterwards and he told me this waitress has a history of doing this.  She should be fired.  I will not be back plus I spent half my time trying to swat the bugs alway from the food 
Rude and bad food",0
"Was always intrigued by their ""concept"" of meats coming on skewers and sliced right on your plate. And this past weekend, as part of Restaurant Week, got a chance to try them out in person. Was it worth it...No

Decor : A little to dim and red for my taste. From a far it looks fine, but get closer and you notice the slight grime on tables, the even darker ambient furniture. Our chairs had nails sticking out on the edges so that was not nice! (They really outta check that coz that can injure someone)

Service : Pleasant had it been a normal ala carte restaurant but the concept here mars the it down a notch. Once you've tried all meats/veggie ensembles, you basically then ""wait"" until that particular favorite one comes by to you, which mostly doesn't as it would just get devoured by tables before you. And then you keep waiting more....

Food : I'd give the crazy wait a pass had the food been worth the wait. Alas it wasn't. The steak variety was chewy, overly rare and devoid of any seasoning. The pork was better as it came grilled/roasted with Parmesan cheese so the moisture from the cheese helped balance the dryness of the tenderloin. The sausage was average at best and can be associated with one you get from Walmart, laden with salt. The chicken legs were weirdly tiny to make you feel they may have come from ones that were malnutrition-ed!! The lamb was a best ""MEAT"" of the worst. It too lacked seasoning and was cooked a tad dry. But the char on the outside skin gave it the a much needed boost of flavor.

Long story short - Meat varieties tragically disappointing with over cooking and gross lack of seasoning/flavors.

Now the reason why this place got 2 stars instead of 1. The absolutely and sinfully sumptuous Grilled Cinnamon Pineapple!!! Take it from me, I'm not a pineapple guy and but man o man was that  good or what!! We must've had 3 courses of it and had to wait easily 10 mins between each (The hungry parties before our table gobbled them all up before it could come to us!!) but worth it.

The so called ""Unlimited Buffet"" section has a few hits (brazilian nuts, goat cheese) but overall doesn't help bring up the atmosphere of average cooked meats going around.

Despite being Restaurant Week, it came to be $30 pp before drinks, tip and taxes. Nopes, not worth that money. I'd spend that kind anyday on better dining delights in Madison :)",0
"If you're able to get fiber internet, it's worth it. Fast and had minimal downtime in the 2 years I've had it. I work full time from home and I only had a handful of issues over 2 years.

So why the 2 stars?

If you have to deal with customer service or god forbid the billing department, prepare to spend most of your day if not a couple of days on hold and repeating the same issue over and over again until you finally reach one intelligent person that helps you. Their downfall is their customer service. It's probably the worst I've dealt with and I've dealt with Cox and Comcast. 

The bonus to having fiber internet is that you get L2 local phone support. As a software engineer I understand networking and computers, their L2 fiber support is great because they are knowledgeable people, not some tech moron reading a script. 

Also, never settle for their advertised prices. Don't get a contract either. I was paying $80/mo for the fiber internet only and not on a contract. 

tl;dr

Fast and stable fiber internet if you can deal with complete incompetence when you need ""customer service""",0
"Was ok i ordered fish and chips, the fish batter was like cutting through wood.   It was very dry inside.

There was a table of drunk guys and we almost left because they were so rowdy and moved outside. 

Server was good to us and friendly.

Not sure if we will ever go back to this place.",0
"The 2 ladies working here were very nice. The soup I ordered was very good. I ordered a sandwich to go and was surprised to see it was wrapped in plastic wrap. 
Sandwiches wrapped in plastic makes rolls rubbery as well as making the sandwich soggy when the sandwich has mayo, mustard, tomatoes etc. anything with liquid (if not eaten right away). I hope they change this to a paper wrap because the ham was good but by the time I got to eat my sandwich it was rubbery and soggy.",0
"I got the 12.99 basic wash. Pulled up & there was no sign to wait or what to do. Finally ten minutes later someone comes up. I ask how long it'll be for the ""basic"" and he tells me ten minutes max. It's been over an hour and I am still waiting for my car. Not worth the time or money.",0
"So I decided I will try then once again, and they prove again why I should continue to refuse going there.  I checked in and was told to pick out my gel color, then Casey told me it would be 10-15 minutes, which I was ok with.  About 10 min later another girl walked up and told me to pick out my color, which I had already done, then she walked me back to an empty station next to Cindy, who was doing another girls gel manicure.  I was given no other instruction but to sit.  As I sat there and watched Cindy do this girls nails, I noticed she started trying to hurry, which led me to believe that she was trying to hurry so she could do mine next.  Which to me is not ok, first don't sit me down at an empty station to wait and make the tech feel rushed and also make the customer feel uncomfortable that I'm just sitting their .  After another 10-15 minutes and knowing how long gel takes, I got up and said ""I'll just come back tomorrow"" which just to be clear, I will not be returning tomorrow, or any day after that.",0
Ordered sushi for lunch take out. Was expecting good sushi due to the reviews but it was just so-so. And the green onions which were garnish for our Joes Special roll were spoiled and smelled bad. Fish was not chilled so sushi did not taste fresh. Did not care for it.,0
"I was incorrectly billed $11.52 for fuel charges.  When I called to dispute the error, I spoke with Lian Santon.  At first she told me the charge was because the company undercharged me for the vehicle.  When I explained that I made the purchase through hotwire, she then switched the reason for the charge to me upgrading my vehicle at the counter, which was incorrect.  After being placed on hold for a while, she told me the fee was for fuel, yet I brought the vehicle back on full.  After being placed on hold for over 30 min, she told me that they would only be able to credit back $8 and not the full $11.52 because the other $3.52 was included in taxes.  Another representative called back to tell me that the company would have to call the car rental location and verify that the car was brought back on full before I could receive the other $3.52.  This is pointless to me because if an associate entered a fuel charge in error and the transaction happened weeks ago, it would be difficult to remember this particular transaction given the large volume of rental returns that have taken place since then.",0
"I hate having to write this review, but alas our visit at this hotel was gross to say the least.  The Flamingo is generally a go to for our Vegas vacations, we usually stay in the newly remodeled ""Go Rooms"" which are fantastic! Clean, cute and a great location. 

However, this visit we booked a ""Fab Luxury"" room. I didn't realize what a difference there was in the rooms! First of all it took over an hour to check in because it was overcrowded and under staffed. That's all fine and dandy, stuff happens right? Now, we finally got to our room, after an exhausting and hot drive to Vegas, only to be repulsed upon entry. The bead spread (which is furry for reasons I can't figure out), had some funky, brown, sticky goop on it that caused the fuzz to all clump together in some disgusting pink clustergunk.  Ok, gross so I pulled it off the bed and tossed it aside. We continue to settle in and realize that the lamp table and floor beneath are COVERED in sticky nasty mystery sludge, to the point that I can make out footprints in the gunk.  This is followed by the discovery of clumps of hair on the bathroom floor and a filthy tub. 

This was all enough for me to be seriously grossed out. We tried calling the front desk to no avail. So, I marched down to speak to someone in person.  The girl at the desk was very pleasant and informed me that normally they would move us to another room, but because it was booked solid she would have someone come up right away to clean. We waited, and waited, and then we waited. Nothing, the entire night. We went to eat, walk around and still no one had come. 

The next morning, we went out and about for the day and saw that someone was coming to clean our room, excellent! So we thought. We came back to the room after a few hours to find that everything was exactly the same, save for the made beds and a few new towels. So, again I go downstairs to speak with someone. I am told once again that someone will come clean right away. We go to our room, and wait. What do you know...someone came. A grumpy, disgruntled, irritated woman came and aggressively scrubbed the goop off of the floor and table and then handed me some towels and left.  

Overall, I was extremely disappointed by The Flamingo. The food court was closed the whole time we were there, our room was absolutely filthy and the pool closes at 6pm (how lame). Next time around I think we may just spend a little more and stay somewhere with some standards. Massive fail Flamingo.",0
What is wrong with this place? Seems like it creates a uproar in the kitchen just ordering a cheesburger (which I never got). I'll never go there again.,0
"The food is great. The service is.. bad.. very bad.

Upon arrival we were told just go find a seat anywhere there was only 1 booth open and 2 with tons of dishes on them. We went to the open booth because we have a baby and it's easier to block her into the inside of a booth. We go to the booth and it was super dirty the server came by and cleaned it for us after a few minutes. She came back and took our drink orders at which point we also ordered the street fry appetizer. They were delicious but they took 15 minutes to get out which in my opinion is a long time for fries. While we were waiting for the appetizer we ordered our main course. We were 1 of 2 tables left at this point. After finishing the appetizer it was another 20 minutes for the main course in which time our server never returned to our table to refill our glasses which were all empty at this point or to even ask how we were doing. FINALLY our food shows up on their station with the heat lamps where it sat , while our server chatted with the bartender, for another 10 minutes. She finally decided to bring us our food and says oh I'll be back to refill your drinks which didn't happen for ANOTHER 10 minutes. She finally returned and 1 of my party of 4 sent their wings back. They were burnt to a crisp and cold simultaneously..weird.. she offered to bring him a slice of pizza, which she did, after yet another 15 minutes. At this point nobody was hungry anymore everyone's food was cold so we sat, another 15 minutes. Before finally I got up and asked the server who again was chatting with the bar tender for our boxes and our bill. She brings our bill fairly quickly at that point.. the only thing she did quickly. Honestly.. if it wasn't for the amazing pizza here it would be a 1 star review, but, the food really is very good. Just order it to go.. you don't want to leave with a bad taste in your mouth from the untrained service who couldn't care less about you or your experience.",0
"I come to Vegas once or twice a year, though I had never stayed at Paris hotel.  After this visit, not again.  The spa at Paris, is the worst place I have ever seen.  It is unkept, dirty, scummy and smells like dirty feet.  The facilities are horrible.  The attendant frankly lazy and rude. Do not waste a penny.  I have seen high school gyms more appealing.",0
"The hotel is in a not great part of town. I walked into the lobby and it was so stuffy and hot. The room itself was okay, it was clean, except for in the bathtub there was mold on the faucet. The breakfast in the morning was decent. but the feeling of the lobby and hallways were very uncomfortable because there's no air flowing through.",0
This place really is as ratchet as it gets. Staying here for 3 nights and my room hasn't been cleaned. Nor have I gotten any fresh towels. Oh and I have a low-fi tube TV in my room? Really?,0
Got a great deal on the set if tires I bought but I can not believe the level incompetence when I spoke with the mechanics. I came back to pick up my car and found the back latch to my car to be completely broken. The lock appeared to have been tampered with and was loose. I looked inside my car and the bolts appeared to have been loosened as if someone was looking at it. I went to ask one of the mechanics and all he said was I don't know what to tell ya...,0
Le service est excellent ma note ne viens pas de l√† mais plut√¥t de la propret√© g√©n√©rale des lieux et des plats peu rago√ªtants. √áa fesait des ann√©es que je n'avais pas mis les pieds dans un buffet et apr√®s cette exp√©rience je ne suis pas pr√™te d'y retourner c'est √† n'y rien comprendre que l'endroit soit toujours bond√© le soir,0
"I'll start by saying that my boyfriend and I have been to many PT's in the city and they have all been pretty awesome. We were enjoying this location until we were slapped with a bill without even asking for it and the bartender saying ""here's what you guys owe, just so you know."" We were no where close to finished and came here to enjoy an evening together to get some snacks and to play some Keno. We collectively put about $500+ through the machines and we were charged for mostly all of our drinks.

We're not ones to ask for free items ever as we are both in the service industry and understand they have to make money as well (in which we always make sure to take care of our bartenders very well because we go off the original amount of the bill) but as a local you know it's typically customary for drinks to be comped, especially when playing the machines. (Which we played for roughly 5-6 hours for the entire duration of the time we were here.)

He left and incredibly bad taste in our mouth after this action of his and we found this to be INCREDIBLY rude. 

After years of loyalty to the company, many long nights, many football games and thousands of dollars played through the machines we're just disappointed. I hope that things will be improved in the future. 

Sadly, we probably will not be visiting this location again.",0
Scam to up-sale very expensive service.  If you don't play the game they take your money and spray water everywhere and leave it very wet.,0
"There wasn't one specific thing that made this buffet so horrible... It's just the accumulation of everything being less than average quality. There are plenty of options, but none of them were flavorful, hot, or worth filling up on.

Some others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side. The Asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland.

The worst part is that when I was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on TOP of the pizza... So all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! There were two workers right there who didn't think this was disgusting.. I would have discarded the slices.

My husband and I both left with unsatisfied stomachs and looked forward to the second dinner we would have a few hours later at a much better establishment.",0
"So originally my review was going to have a few more stars but took some away and you can read to see why.

So originally was really excited to try this place. Had seen a lot of the pictures of the breakfast food and read some reviews. We were enjoying football Sunday and New Year's Day so we weren't in the mood to cook and thought it would be the perfect time to try this place.

Ordered over the phone, got a fit and focused veggie delite omelette with no mushroom. 

Husband ordered corned beef hash breakfast 

He went to pick it up, they showed him both things and the girl even read everything back and everything sounded correct, she even mentioned the no mushrooms . Husband saw no mushrooms on the omelette as well. We timed it perfectly so that husband got back right after halftime and when I went to take first bite it was filled with mushroom, tried to take them out but it was just a mess after that. 

Called them to complain , they were super busy which is understandable . I remember the manager asking if they showed it to us. Like yes but we didn't have a fork to open up the food and check inside . 

He asked what register it was rung up on and how we paid and said there might be two charges shown due to the fact that he would be doing a charge back or something for the cost of the food without the veggie omelette .  However nothing showed up. We were never comped . And the day of we didn't have them remake it because my husband didn't want to leave again during the game to go get it ... and they were so busy I don't think they wanted to remake it anyways. 

My husband and I shared his and mine was thrown away and we were both left unsatisfied. 

A manager lying and saying he will pull a receipt and refund you and not doing so, leaves a bad taste , on top of getting a simple order wrong .",0
No stars for this business..Dropped off a dress for alteration on a Saturday with a promise to complete on Thursday. Showed up to pick up dress on Friday morning and not done. No apology and not even an excuse. If I didn't have a party in Friday I would have taken unaltered dress and left. Done last minute with a lot of stress. Will not return to this business. Not reliable.,0
"I usually love this place. It's been a great little spot of good dessert after a meal up in old town. But after doing much research and reading the other reviews, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. The fact that multiple people have said they have encountered cockroaches at this establishment, no way Jose for me.",0
"Came here for the ayce seafood buffet what a disappointment.the crab lags,muscles,and crawl fish was served over a bed of ice the crab was almost frozen and mush.the clams was ok. The only redeeming part of this was the cook that was making fresh seafood pasta.other then that if you are coming for the seafood buffet save your money their are other places that will cook it for you and not short cut it. Oh and service was less the Desirable",0
"This review is not for the food or dining, it's only for the reservation & host/management experience.  In short, making a reservation means nothing!  I reserved a table for 4 on Saturday night at 7:15pm to welcome my colleagues to a nice meal while staying at the M Resort & Casino.  It was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation. I asked if we could go to the bar while we wait, and she said there was no room there either.  So we went to a Casino bar & came back 30 minutes later, and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes.  They weren't at all polite, they acted like we were being a pain for coming back. SERIOUSLY?!  So I asked them to take my number down & call me when the table was ready, and she begrudgingly did.  Well, they NEVER called me to say our table was ready.... good thing we snagged one at the Burger & Brews place next door.


Clearly, Anthony's doesn't know how to manage their reservations.... obviously an OpenTable reservation doesn't guarantee you a table.  We were super let down because the menu looks great, but I can't comment on that.",0
"So I stayed here because the event I was attending was here and they offered a great price for Memorial Day weekend.  That is where the good stuff ended.  We waited close to an hour to check in...at 1am!  Then to help us feel better about that we got an ""upgraded"" room.  Got to the room and there was a dressed up Murphy bed that folded into the wall.  To be fair it was comfortable...however if that was an upgrade, I really do not want to see the regular rooms.  Next the Internet was $14 per 24hrs.  When we went to use the safe it wasn't working.  To their credit they did say it would take 30 min for someone to come look and it only took 10 and he fixed it within five minutes.  Just felt like if the room price wasn't so great on a holiday weekend I would have been extremely upset.  Know you are not getting super customer service...just getting basic stuff without the class even if they try to say it is classy.",0
"One of the worst HOB I have been to.  My wife and I went here on a weekday and it wasn't too crowded. Decent looking place. My waitress was nice, but she reminded me of the gal that was on Seinfeld, a low talker.  I could barely hear anything she was saying.  I hoped I didn't misunderstand anything she said and ended up with a meal I didn't order.
I ordered a shrimp po' boy.  The shrimp was just okay, no spiceyness to it, but the bread it travelled in was bad.  It literally fell apart when I tried to pick it up. For the price, not even remotely worth it.
My wife ordered a salad.  It was lettuce with a small chunk of blue cheese on the top and dressing on the side.  For nine bucks. And though this is no fault of HOB, my wife didn't like the lettuce offered and she asked for another kind.  They did not offer anything else.
Very disappointing meal.  Lots of waitresses and waiters standing around.  It seems like this place is going on it's rock and roll reputation. We will not be back, at least not this location.",0
The food looked like it was prepared in old grease and had a taste to match. Wings and fries were over cooked and dry. It's cheap but you definitely get what you pay for. I won't ever be back. I would rather not eat at all.,0
"UPDATE...So...against my better judgement l decided to give this place another try. Big mistake! They are a complete rip off place, still trying to sell you things you don't need. I wanted to get new break pads and rotors because my steering wheel shakes a bit when I brake from a high rate of speed and my car has 72,000 miles so I figured it was a good idea. They told me $250 and they could do it today. Well, they take my car back and then they come out and tell me that I need new drums because mine are warped and shocks and struts, yada yada...Suddenly it's a $1,400 job. I just had it at the dealer for a recall and they said they did an inspection and didn't mention any of this so I decide to wait and get a second opinion. So, I ask them to write all this down for me...Suddenly, the shocks and struts are mileage recommended, not because they've noticed anything wrong with them and the drums are just ''slightly'' warped. I'll be curious to see what the dealer says. It is so disheartening not to have a reliable place to take my car that doesn't just want to rip me off.",0
"This is about the Buckeye location.
My experience with this company was horrific. It is bad enough that your vehicle gets towed but then to have to deal with an agency that is dishonest, rude, unscrupulous and participates in the behavior of cheating the public , makes the experience that much worse. 
This company has a $50 fee to have your car released on a day it is closed or after hours. However, they do not tell you that even AFTER you ask for options on how to pick up your vehicle. Instead, they hold your car for an additional 3 days and charge you $30 a day simply telling you that it's not their job to provide you with  truthful answers to the questions you've asked. Great job DV TOWING, robbing the public and generating gain on the back of this cities residents. I will be going a step further and reporting them. I've already forgiven them but I hope that they will experience financial consequences for their poor business practices. As a public we deserve to deal with trustworthy companies, no matter what their occupation. No wonder their ratings are so low!",0
This place is clean and a great price the other places around is are horrible and have undesirable types (I.e. hookers) not here safe and quiet no bedbugs a huge plus would recommend it to anyone unless you are from the Phoenix area they will not rent to you unless you live more than 30 miles away after our 3rd stay we were informed of this policy such is stupid and discrimination of Phoenix and surrounding area residents so I'm going to file a complaint with corporate and talk to my lawyer!,0
"Hadn't been here in about two years and remembered that it was good so we went back. The place has gone downhill. They used to staff the place appropriately to keep the line moving but now it's excruciatingly slow. Ordered a Chicago style, asked if they knew how to make it and they said yes. They did not. The hot dog was literally half the size of the bun and it had hot sauce on it. I, at first, mistook it for ketchup and took it back. When they said it was hot sauce I asked why they put hot sauce on my hot dog and they just stared blankly. Husbands burger resembled a tiny hockey puck. They seem to clearly be cutting corners on staffing, ingredients, and training and it shows.",0
"They installed the WRONG spark plugs in my vehicle, which I later found was the cause of engine knock and a rough idle. The owner is a coward who is unprofessional, belligerent, rude and likes to use bully tactics when he's safe behind a phone. Trust me and the rest of the reviewers here... Save your money, hair and lifespan of your motor by either driving or having it towed to a local dealership or some other reputable auto mechanic who respects and knows your vehicle.",0
"Like most other reviewers have said. This place for their featured Bon Bon drinks are definitely overpriced $12.99. I got the strawberry Bon Bon...Bottom is strawberry slush (made with syrup and ice), fresh strawberries and whip cream. 

Would I come back again? Maybe not.",0
"I bought a groupon for laser. And im very disappointed because i didnt see any results. The technician was always very nice and kind, getting a hold of them by phone or anything was annoying. I went to all my sessions, before the last one I was offered to extend it, of course I refused because of the lack of results and I am not saying that I saw an improvement of at least 20%, maybe a 5% at the most. By the last session, the technician, always nice and kind, finished the procedure and disappeared, i went to the front desk and nobody was to be seen, i waited a bit but they seemed to be very entertained talking somewhere else so I just left feeling even more disappointed about their services and  respect for customers. I will never go back there, even if is with a groupon, is a total waste of money and time.",0
"Average coffee. Decided to try Mayorga at the recommendation of a friend and was disappointed. The espresso lacked any kind of rich or creamy quality and tasted like a latte you would order at McDonalds or Sheets. They have a mixture of Torani and Monin syrups, and it would have been nice to know which flavor was what brand as Monin syrups are much better quality and probably would've helped. However, the staff was friendly. Prices are a bit expensive but hey, it's an airport.",0
"The receptionist at my PCP's office recommended Dr. Gimel but I never got to see him. Instead they made an appointment with his PA, David Rueb. My PCP suggested I had an issue with my SI joint.

The younger lady with dark hair at the front desk is quite rude. So I was already kinda bummed out. A assistant with arm tattoos called me back and took my vitals. He was really friendly, I wish I could remember his name. Finally David Rueb makes his way into the exam room. He immediately starts in on my x-ray, which BTW you ""MUST"" have before they'll even book you an appointment. He states there's nothing wrong with my back. I tell him my symptoms. And he immediately says it's sciatica. So first there's nothing wrong and now I have sciatica? Okay. I mention how my PCP suggested an MRI to possibly rule out SI joint and he says no. He assures me it's sciatica. And prescribed Naproxen and 3 weeks of physical therapy. I again ask if we could just have an MRI done just in case as I'm in serious pain and I don't really have sciatica symptoms. No again, and schedules another visit with him in 30 days. 

Well, come to find out he misdiagnosed me, just as my PCP suggested. I saw another ortho doctor who w/o  question knew it was my SI joint and not sciatica. If Rueb had only set aside his ego and condescending attitude and ordered additional imaging I could've been on my way to recovery. 

When I called to cancel my second appointment the rude girl even asked why I was canceling. Don't worry about it! I don't know how Dr. Gimbal is but I do not recommend David Rueb. What a knucklehead!",0
The barbecue was good although I do feel like it is very overpriced to Steffes not usually very friendly when I go to the takeout here but then again maybe it's just me if you want good barbecue there's plenty of other places you can go,0
"Dot dot dot has gone from decent to worse. I've been here several times and each one has been progressively worse. I recently showed up with a group of 5 and was told that I could use the NoWait App to register my party to enter later after eating at Sir Edmund Halley's. The app did not let you register 5 people for the wait list and we instead registered for 4. When we showed up, we were told we were in the wrong for showing up with one more person and were forced to go back on the wait list which was another 40 minutes (there was no line outside and people were pouring out of the bar). You guys need to do some work with your seating methods. How does one person cause you to have to wait another 40 minutes to be seated? I would like to understand before I come back. I will also be urging others to avoid until this is figured out.",0
I wish I knew what everybody likes about this place.  Second time was as bad as the first time.  But it will likely be my last time.  The food is mediocre and the service is way below par.  I waited a good ten minutes before a waitress came by to tell me she would be right back to take my order.  5 minutes later she came by.  Coffee cup was filthy.  The overall experience was just lousy.,0
"Been here a few times previously.  As the other reviews mentioned, the pho sucked (thick flat rice noodles, crappy broth, etc).  No love for Xe Lua unfortunately.",0
Signed up for Costco bulk bottle program couple years ago- been a loyal customer.  Dealt with many invoicing and billing errors and their customer service department is terrible to deal with.   Just found out that the Costco program was discontinued and my bill is literally TWICE the discounted costco amount.  They claimed to notify customers but I never received anything.  Cancelled service - not worth the price they are charging now.  Save your money and invest in a water cooler and get your bottles elsewhere!,0
"10pm on a super bowl Sunday and they're already closed?? Weak, no wonder the hard Rock is dying off...",0
"3 stars for food, but the service was awful. Appetizers were ordered and all the food was brought out at once after wondering where the food was. Saw multiple tables served while we sat around waiting for the check. Won't be back!",0
Had to get them to wipe the dash they missed the center part and they use very little soap on your vehicle I will not go back,0
"There is a nice selection of original items for babies, plenty of maternity wear and nursing bras- though very pricey.
The snacks such as banana bread and carrot bread were fine but nothing special. The ingredients are not written on the packaging -  so not great for those with allergies. 
The play areas for babies and toddlers looked as though they had not been cleaned in a while which was probably the biggest turn off. 

Overall it seems as though there is potential but it is not a place I would return to anytime soon, nor would I recommend it just yet.",0
I ordered a lap top battery from the site and you got a 10% discount to pick up in store. Then I get a call. They don't have the battery and need to look for it. Then I get a call the battery is nowhere in the universe for some reason and they offered my money back. My question is WHY IN THE HELL DO YOU OFFER IT ON THE SITE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BATTERY? What a waste of time.,0
"All I can say is bad food, there is no such a Indian flavor taste waste of money
Don't spend ur money",0
"One of my favorite places to shop , always very friendly 
However sales person in designer shoes made us feel like 2nd rate citizens 
Purchased a pair of Prada sneakers for my daughter 
Thought maybe it was just me that thought sales person treated us like  we did not belong there 
Asked my daughter and  she felt exactly the same 
It is my first time shopping there where someone made me feel very uncomfortable 
We were not just window shopping 
We came in for the Prada sneakers 
Anyway we were very excited walking in there 
Not so much when we left 
She might have had a bad day 
Still no excuse to act ""snotty""",0
"The last time we ordered from this place is took an hour and a half to get our food. We decided to give it another try, we ordered tonight, they said it would be 45 mins-1 hour. THREE HOURS later we call them ( for a second time) and they say the pizza is still at the restaurant, ""we got busy, we can't help it"". I can understand getting busy, but why would anybody even want a pizza that's been sitting there for more than 2 hrs?! And we're less than 5 miles down Durango from them. The food is decent, but we won't be ordering from them again. Don't waste your time.",0
"Honestly? It tasted weird. I was visiting extended family and we bought two pizzas--1/2 veggie/meat and one cheese. The sauce was too sweet and the veggies were not at all what I expected. Now, Mineo's...better pizza.",0
"grape leaves were the tiniest we've ever eaten!  About the size of a cocktail frank, and about as remarkable.  The lemon piece served with them was dried out. The hummus, though tasty, was VERY thick!  Almost like cutting into a soft cheese - not spreadable.  We asked for some oil to add to it and felt that that was really a just so-so solution.  I doubt seriously that it was freshly made - thinking it had been sitting around for a while.  
Our pastitsio was ok - not very hot when served though, my guess is that it was microwaved.  Our pasta (ziti)  was the worst we've had in a restaurant ever - in that it was SO overdone.  Normally, if a dish isn't perfect , we will not ask for a replacement, but this was luke warm and SO mushy and starchy and tasteless. The server explained something that I really didn't want to know - that the pasta is precooked at the beginning of the day and then reheated ! - not cooked to order.  Our server was accomodating, but the whole experience was much less than wonderful.  While we expect ethnic music in an ethnic restaurant, theirs was so loud that after a couple times around the play list we were really quite ready to leave and had our 2nd plate of ziti (only slightly less mushy) packaged to go.  a big disappointment - glad we had a groupon.  BUT - it turns out that our server's insistance that the groupon required us to order two entrees (rather than the mix of soup/salad and one entree we'd planned to order) was NOT true. We didn't have the groupon with us - only on my phone and I didn't look closely at it until I got home and looked at it more closely on my lap  top. SO that less than hot, overdone ziti was the dish that we actually didn't plan to order - but we had to, and that pushed our lunch order over the $30 limit of the groupon -- just an overall bad lunch experience - after a previous lunch there which was much better.",0
All these people care about is getting paid. This is not a review by someone who has only been there once. I have taken 2 dogs and a cat there for years and spent thousands of dollars.  They are condescending and do not communicate with each other.  They are not good at checking previous history of our visits.  I am glad others have had a positive experience but every time I go in there it makes me cringe inside. My wife did not share my opinion and that is why we continued to go there. After today's visit where they were rude to her and accused her of being a bad pet owner she finally agrees with me. We will be switching vets and would not recommend this place to anyone,0
"Place was new/clean.  Sushi NOT good.  Your ingredient choices are very limited and low quality, the rice gets kind of hard because it sits around in pre-prepped sheets.  There is no artistry (or Asians), as they use a machine to make your sushi, which I'm skeptical about based on principal, but also because it's on the counter all day at room temp cutting raw fish.  

No music and empty, so kind of eerie while eating, and more of a subway feel than asian.  People are commenting on how they get to customize the sushi here... but you can do that at any sushi place.  Anyway, for me.. High prices for low quality sushi = not worth going back.",0
Bad. The tacos are not good. Cold. Hard. Tortillas were probably out for awhile. I don't know what else to say other than save your money and go have tacos elsewhere.,0
The taxi never showed up. I had this experience twice. They didn't show up after I called at 5 am when no one else would need a taxi. They suck. Don't use them.,0
Had to get them to wipe the dash they missed the center part and they use very little soap on your vehicle I will not go back,0
"The previous reviews that mention the service problems are absolutely correct, it is horrible.  We have visited this restaurant several times over the last few years and it has really gone downhill.  You very rarely see a waiter even when the dining room is practically empty.  Yesterday we went for a late lunch and were seated right away in a booth.  There were three tables in the entire place that were occupied by a total of 7 people.  We sat, looked at the menus, and waited...and waited....and waited...and got up and left.  10 mins is my max time in an empty restaurant without seeing a server.  That will be out last visit, too bad, I thought the food was ok for a chain restaurant.",0
Standing here watching them get everybody order wrong. Waited 6 minutes for 2 sausage muffin no cheese. Yikes,0
"These guy's were at the Chandler Ostrich Festival 2010.
My daughter wanted a smoked turkey leg, big belly's bbq were the only vendor that was selling smoked turkey legs. So I decided to go ahead and get one for her. I waited in line, paid for my order ($10 for one leg) and started waiting in another line...

Little did I know that these people were accepting money for product that wasn't even cooked yet. 40 minutes later with about 30 people behind me, I finally got the leg. We walked to the stage at this event, took our seats and I noticed that my 11 year old daughter was barely even picking at it. I asked her why she wasn't eating and she gave me a lame excuse...

Now my daughter is a healthy eater, but she also doesn't like to complain. (She also realized that we had waited almost an hour for the turkey to finish cooking and didn't want to be a pain)

I decided to try some of it.

It was moist, but it tasted awful. Sort of like a combination of raw egg and raw poultry.
 
By this time I was pretty pissed, not only had I wasted 10 dollars on sub-standard meat, but also 45 minutes of my time!

I really wanted to see the band that was playing since that was the main reason we went. (http://www.wartheband.com/home.html)
After they were finished playing I took the leg back and they just blew me off as though I was trying to rip them off.

The bottom line is that  these people cannot seem to handle large events or even maintain a consistent product.
 Keep that in mind the next time you have any remote urge to hire these people. 
Horrible food, horrible customer service, but they will gladly take your money.",0
"Spent over $30 trying to order a new 52 comic book with a hard cover from this store. I attempted to cancel this order via phone today during business hours with nobody answering at all, three weeks after placing this order with nothing to show for it. When I arrived to the store in person to cancel the request, they claimed it could not be done; their reasoning was nobody would ever buy the hard cover of this book, at a COMIC BOOK store. This comment was than followed up with the idea of getting a fraction of the money back as store credit...

Got the same hardcover book for 12 dollars on Amazon in two days.

My bank agreed, I had every right to not process the transaction due to lack of service, and it was canceled on my behalf and determined to be fraud.",0

She even asked me to brush my own daughters hair because it would take too long for her to do it. Here is a little advice April, get her wet and spray some detangler in it and it comes out. Needless my daughter was hysterical and I promised her we would NEVER go back there. I  disgusted this woman has no compassion and clearly is lazy and doesn't want to work hard. If it was possible I would give NEGATIVE stars, please my fellow Vistancia people go to the lake pleasant one!!",0
"I've  been coming here for close to 15 years... every time it gets worse. Food that used to be awesome, has gown seriously downhill and so has the service. We wont be back.",0
"The food here is pretty tasty, but the last few times I have ordered wings and fries, they were quite crappy due to the oil being very old. Please change out your oil when it gets nasty, it makes tasty junk food, just taste like junk.",0
"WORSE LUNCH EVER... Just went to pick up a shrimp burrito bowl for lunch and it was the worse EVER! It was freezing cold, things weren't mixed, there were like 4 shrimps and soo little lettuce.  The staff didnt look like they knew what to put in... I usually love the bowl at Chipotle's and Burrito Boys'... this was a very poor version... Will never eat there again.",0
"The artwork is great.  Very striking and captivating images that seemingly pop out of the frames with the vibrant  hues and colors.

The studio and it's salesmanship/service is decidedly less than impressive.   I ordered two pieces, Gorillas in The Mist and Tree of Truth.  The original art dealer who made our transaction was let go for untold reasons and was replaced by someone else(Mike?).   I only know this because I called to get a follwup on the delivery of the photographs because I have yet to hear from the guy who took over the account.  I think if someone took over the account, they should be taking the initiative to notify the customers of that change.  I basically had been getting no response from the emails I sent to my original dealer, and I had to call to find out what happened.

About four weeks later, I received the Tree of Trurth(alternatively called Wisdom Tree).  However, it was only by accident that I received it.  I stopped by my local USPS office to pick up an article by another merchant, and to my surprise the clerk brought me a package from the Rodney Lough Studio.  I have no idea how  long it had been at the USPS office, because I was never notified by Mike, or frankly anyone from this Las Vegas studio that the piece had been shipped out.  I wasn't notified by USPS either, but we all know and expect crappy service from the USPS - the main difference is that I didn't pay USPS thousands of dollars for a certain level of service.  

I am left wondering:

If Rodney Lough Jr. Sells their pieces of artwork as being something of value and something to treasure...Why would they send it via the UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE like its junk mail?? Why not give the customer at least an email notification that it has been sent out???

I wonder if the people at the Peter Lik galleries provide better customer service?  Something that extends beyond the swipe of the credit card?  

I am glad the Wisdom Tree was not lost or damaged in the USPS office, but I certainly expected better service than I have received.  Still waiting on the Gorillas in the Mist....hopefully it will be delivered to my door like they originally promised, and not by USPS.",0
5 stars for the doctor he is a good doctor. Zero stars for Kenia the front lady who has no idea what customer service is. Its a shame that for staff like her they have to lose patients. Of course they don't care because its not their business they just want to get their check. Horrendous service. I just wonder why people that hate customer service work in that environment smh. Don't even bother calling for an appointment because they will hang up on you or just leave you on hold for 25 min. And if you're lucky they pick up the phone with an attitude. Great!,0
"DO NOT EVER TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!!!

I went into this location after being told over the phone that they had a brake special of 50% off services. That was a lie.

I take my car in the next day and as I was waiting, I overheard a customer telling the men at the front desk her brand new brakes she just purchased and had installed at this Meineke were grinding and making an awful noise. (I should have left then, considering I too needed brake service). I made the mistake of staying.

My car is looked at by one of the ""mechanics""who calls my boyfriend and I outside to tell us the quote, I see a quote for $997. How brakes and one rotor costs nearly $1000 is beyond me. But the quote wasn't the worst part. 

After I clearly disagree with the charges and opt to take my vehicle somewhere else, the man proceeds to tell me, he will not allow me to drive my vehicle away due to the condition of my brakes, and I would have to tow my car off their shop. They claim it's the law. However when I sign a waiver I assume all responsibility of my car and I also make it clear I am aware of the supposed danger of my vehicle. Meienke was not abiding by law they were trying to waste my time, after I disagreed with their bogus charges. Obviously they use this tactic as a way to get fools to just stay and have the services done there. I didn't and as soon as I said I still did not want brake services done there, the nice guy act went out the window. They were very rude and  condescending to me as I waited for the tow truck to arrive.


I would never bring my car here again. These are not true mechanics. They are just a bunch of men who take advantage of unsuspecting people by charging them more money than their services will ever be worth. Do yourself a favor and never visit this or any other Meineke store. Terrible service, and a terrible experience is all you will get when coming here, trust me.",0
"Been here for a few years before. My mom still goes here to get a perm & cut, my sister comes to get her hair straightened. 
Really liked the way how my sisters hair is done so I thought maybe I should give it a try. Called to book an appointment and explained the condition of my hair to the male staff. Knowing that I'm calling a week ahead for that specific day to get my hair done. He says you need to come in for us to see how your hair is on a weekday. I said I need to work on weekdays and the best day is on the weekend. So I've asked for that day and he said ""well, I don't want to book you in and then you not doing it. I don't want to ask a stylist to come in and then calling it off because it takes a third of a time"". VERY UPSET with this kind of service. Pretty much asking my family and friends not to go there anymore.",0
"good service , nice ambiance...terrible pancakes",0
"I stayed there from 12/23/2011 to 12/24/2011.  The room was very small and everything was very very old especially the bathroom.  It is like you are walking to a Victorian house.  The carpet has some stains on it, too.  Thanks God that I had stayed only two nights.  On the third night, we switched to South Point.  Although it was far away from the strip, everything was new - the room was very big and the bathroom was also very modern and comfortable.  In addition, South Point's buffet was only $3.30/person after using 50% coupon.",0
"It's a production brewery and not much else. In that matter, no tasting room and you can't just visit it out of the blue.

They have a tour once a month. It's pretty much walk in and stand in one spot because its a very small spot.

The beers aren't anything special and that might be because they constantly change their recipes. Their one-offs tend to be their best bets but consistency in making them again is apparently tough for the brewery. (Hence ""one-off"")

Better bet going to Tenaya Creek or Big Dogs where you can see the Brewery as well as drink there. Banger Brewing downtown is also highly recommended.",0
"If this past visit 1/29 was my first time - this might have gotten less stars. I hate hate hate giving bad reviews and I always try to seek out the things I like rather than the things I don't like - but I had a real ""boner kill"" experience this past time. 

I have gone here a few times in the past and had no problems and felt like everything was so quality. Today my boyfriend and I go after a long day and I order my fave - barn burner (add avocado) with zucchini and an extra little cup of ranch. We get our food, no avocado or extra ranch. Oh well, not a big deal! I check my receipt to triple check I paid for it - there it is! 1 x avocado $0.99! I go up to the front thinking it would be no big deal. I tell the sweet waitress, Erica, that I didn't get any avocado and ask if I can have some in a condiment cup. She says yes, asks the guy that's closest to her in the kitchen. He accuses me of lying, berates Erica and tells her he knows he put it on my burger. This dude must have issues - why the heck is he making a scene, saying I'm lying and being rude to his coworker? I am so caught off guard by this. I look at Erica and tell her I'll show her my burger and my receipt. I do. She apologize and grabs me my dang avocado. 

Bottom line: waitress was so nice, food is good, cook guy is weird and I don't want to go to this location again. Food is 5/5 quality but cook guy 0/5",0
"I have been a petsmart customer for years. Even make a donation to their charity every time I shop there. Tonight's treatment by Chris and the cashier was unaccepptable. I was trying out different brands of dog kibble. Bought a high quality brand  a couple weeks ago. My dogs wouldn't eat it. Exchanged that for two different brands a week ago (Purina beyond and Hills diet). My dogs wouldn't go near the food. The Hills brand smelled awful. So I went to return the food. I walked in. Saw only one receipt was in the bag. I went to my vehicle to find the other one. When I came back, Chris is standing a few feet away from the register holding my receipt watching for me. I asked if there was a problem. His reply ""well yeah."" He begins questioning me why I am returning the merchandise and mentions I seem to be continuously returning items. His question felt like he was interrogating me. I immediately took offense to his attitude and demeanor towards me. I said, my dogs wouldn't eat either one and one brand smells horrible. And proceeded to say I only returned one bag of food previously. Never returned any items prior to that. The prior cashier who helped me last time let me know food items can be returned if the dogs won't eat the food. Chris continued his line of questioning asking me what am I feeding the dogs now. Am I exchanging for another bag. I answered his questions and I shouldn't have had to. It's none of his business what I feed them now. And I do not want another bag. I'm upset. Frustrated by his actions and I rightfully tell him so. Telling him how I feel he is making me feel. I grabbed my receipt from him which he was holding onto tightly showing I am not liking his service. handed it back to the cashier and Chris continues to tell me, he is allowing the return. Absolutely right he is. Their no hassle free return policy was a huge hassle. I'm clearly unhappy and Chris continues to be a condescending on purpose by asking if there anything more he could do for me. I responded with after they way he treated me, I'm going to ask him for help. He continued his belligerent responces in which I told him to stop. How dare he treat me with such disrespect. As I'm walking out the store he continued to berate me with have a nice day. That is unprofessional. Awful customer service. Petsmart has lost my business for good. My treatment doesn't end with this review. I will be following up with the store manager and their head quarters.",0
"So, for some dumb reason I guess Justice has taken away their store wide 40% off sales and, apparently, have lowered all the regular prices by ""50%"".......I find this very hard to believe when I found a cheapy tshirt marked for $29 now - I'm certain that was not a previously $58 shirt......Justice, you've just lost a few very very good customers!!! I've shopped there with my twins since they could fit into your clothes and have relied on your sales. We'll take our business elsewhere.....until you bring the big sales back. Newsflash - your clothing is not worth $30-50 per item, far from it!!!!",0
"Robuchon was the first 3-star michelin my wife and I had been to (Daniel in NYC only recently attaining their third star).  However, it paled in comparison to many of the 2-starred venues.  The prices are obscene first of all - about double what I've grown accustomed to paying for a  similar experience (even the champagne).  Not to mention, the bites and bubbles menu at Guy Savoy we had tackled two nights prior was MUCH more affordable and more enjoyable.

Our standard 5 course menu began with what was really  an oversized amuse bouche, a chopped apple with spices served in a glass wrapped with pictures of apples.  Good but not worthy of being called an appetizer.  The next dish was cold, shaved foie gras and thin slices of black truffles arranged in a salad.  The truffle slices were old or improperly stored and had absolutely no flavor.  I absolutely love truffles and should have sent it back; huge disappointment.  The foie gras was excellent however.  

The main courses were a boring fish cooked in a unneccesarily huge iron pot and some wagyu steak.  The quality of the steak was amazing, much like the one time I've had authentic prime wagyu before where I was charged far less for the pleasure. 

 The one saving grace of the meal was dessert..  The presentation of a shiny, glittery ball that melted upon contact with a warm sauce was spectacular.  The dessert trolley offered a wide selection of expertly prepared mignardises.  The free take-home box of chocolates was a nice touch.    Service was great but not exceptional and the tables were packed too closely.  

Overall, Robuchon is hardly deserving of 3 michelin stars based on our one experience, though your mileage may vary .  I feel that it was all style over substance and that may be fine for fashion bu not for food.  At half the price, I'd have been more forgiving (3-4 stars), but I felt cheated and given the many other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I don't feel there's any reason to visit Robuchon.  And I say this having gone in with a very positive attitutide after dining at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris, which was exceptional all around.  If you do go to Robuchon, my one piece of advice is to go a la cart, which I didn't realize was an option and seemed almost reasonable.",0
"Expected amazing , not amazing. 
First I was the only one in line instead of greeting me he takes a phone call, not a quick one.

I tried the lobster tacos at 13.18 for the very small portions I was expecting high quality tasting food, it was only average taste and too high price point for serving size.  


The food wasn't horrible , but I wouldn't repeat.",0

"Went for the first time...ordered take-out. I ordered a crab burger with a side of fries (costs $1 more). I ate 1/2 of my sandwich, many because I didn't want to waste my money. The crab sandwich was oily, full of fillers - nauseating. As for the fries, not sure if my order was an afterthought. I received halves and crunchy tips, and the amount provided appeared to be the size of a kids fry at the local fast food joins. Not worth my money.",0
"My experience here was horrific. The service here is terrible. My green curry was so salty, that I had to ask for them to fix it. When they brought it back out, it was still salty. I asked again, this time I asked if I could exchange it for red curry. The waiter said,""No, I can fix it again."" The third time they brought it out; they just added coconut milk and it wasn't even spicy anymore. I will never come here again.",0
"My wife and I went there for our anniversary.  Right after we were seated, someone came over to confirm our names.  (My father had called them to buy us a bottle of wine.)  The waiter knew this, but did not mention it until after we had both ordered very expensive cocktails.  Once we had these and had taken a sip, then he proudly announced the wine gift.  What a dick!  We would never have ordered the cocktails if we had know that we were being bought a bottle of wine!  Then the food was no way near worth the price.  Will never go back, bad move Dresslers..",0
Worst experience ever.  my new car was dented after shopping!! food quality is unacceptable.  hot foods are greasy and I threw it in the garbage after a bite.  They display milk and yogurt in room temperature which I worry about its safety.  The price is very attractive but I don't want to eat sth in my stomach that may hazard to my health.,0

"I have been going to McDonalds a lot lately since I have been constantly on the road, and it's cheap. Usually McDonalds is pretty good about how neat the food is presented, and the other night I decided to swing by here on my way home real quick. I ordered a mcdouble, hot n spicy, and fries. When I got home, the fries were cold (it was only a 5 minute drive home), and the mcdouble and hot n spicy were the messiest sandwiches I have ever had. Granted, it all still tasted good, it's $3, you can't really expect too much I guess. It's just that other McDonalds have been very good lately so this caught me off guard.",0
"Had lunch here the other day and wasn't all that impressed.  FIrst off the parking is very strange you have to park off to the side and walk past an empty boarded up building to get to the front door.  The decor is more rock diner than mexican restaurant, but nice enough.  On a weekday at 12:00 they were completely empty and it's a huge restaurant so that's a little bit of a concern right off the bat.  I had the cheese enchiladas which were ok, not anything special and kinda plain.  The Corn pudding for a side was something you never see and was the best thing on my plate.  The Anaheim Chili stuffed with sweet potato would be better if they removed the skin. It was pretty inedible the way it was served and very messy to scrape the pepper and potato off the skin to eat it.  I will give them props for trying something different, but poor execution at any rate.

The high point was our great server. She was very friendly and really nice. So I think going here for chips and beer on the patio would be cool.",0
"Started our Sonic experience this evening at 7:30pm, attempted to order a heath concrete mixer, was told they were out of heath. Ordered two mixers and a small vanilla ice cream. We waited, waited and waited until 25 minutes later my husband went to ask about our order and was told they are short staffed. They handed him our ice cream and he asked for spoons...THEY WERE OUT OF SPOONS! My husband expressed, ""you have to be flippin' kidding me, half of what you do has a spoon in it!""  Seriously, Mr. Sonic himself would of been disappointed with lack of menu items, the WAIT and NO SPOONS. It's simple really, put someone in charge, wait should never be more than 5 minutes, check your inventory and make sure you have SPOONS :)",0

"I called Garcia Bail Bonds and when the call was answered I was greeted ""Speak""... I proceeded to ask a question about the type of bond I was looking for. The reply was an angry ""what the hell are you talking about?"" I let the person answering know they must not want to make any money talking to customers like that and hung up.

I may not have known what I was talking about since I have never had to bail anyone out before, however the three other bail bonds companies I called prior with the same question were able to provide me an answer minus the horrible attitude.

Why would I ever set foot in a business who can't even handle the simple task of answering a phone call.


Update* In response to the reply.

A. Of course you are "" lost why I feel that way."" You think its normal to answer a phone call  at a place of business with the greeting ""Speak"" and reply to questions with ""what the hell are you talking about""'

B. You do not remember anything. I never said anything about 3% or California. I ONLY asked for a specific type of bond, (because not all bond companies are able to provide this specific type of bond) and your reply was ""what the hell are you talking about"". After that short conversation I terminated our conversation as stated in my review, so there was NO talk of California or 3%. I only included my experience with other bail bonds companies in my REVIEW to highlight how easy it was for me to call another business and not be treated so rudely. 

C. Thank you for letting me know how poor your customer service is so quickly. Made the decision to go else where easy. I write this in hopes that someone else will not get stuck with your company before they get a taste of your horrible customer service.",0
10 min wait for table.  They got my co-worker's order wrong.  Nice view of the planes taking off and landing.,0
"I didn't HATE the place! Hate is a strong word but I wouldn't come back again for its food! My friend says that people come at night and drink. I came here during the middle of the afternoon and I didn't enjoy my experience here. 

Food: They had a lot of asian fusion. I for one, despise Asian fusion cuisine! It's just weird... if i want Asian food, I would get asian food. Unless I have no other alternative... 

I ordered a burger there and it tasted OK. Not something i would pay that much for again. The prices weren't high but taking the taste into consideration, i wouldn't pay over $10 for an OK burger and fries. The french fries weren't that great... I had to force myself to eat it; just so i didn't waste food. 

Service: VERY SLOW. The place was almost empty during the middle of the day but the services wasn't very good. The waiter was slightly stuck-up! He wasn't very friendly but he wasn't rude. He seemed unhappy to be there and serving us. 

The atmosphere: The place looked old like it needs to be renovated. IDK if that's intentional or not.",0
"The food sucked. We left extremely unsatisfied, especially considering that we were super hungry coming in (it wouldn't have taken much to please us). Paid $55 for a meal we didn't finish. Did I mention I was super starving?

Ordered the garlicky butter bake because my boyfriend loves garlic. Turned out to be a disaster. The dish came out much smaller than expected (unlike the picture shown).  The lobster wasn't cleaned, had no flavor, and the meat was way too soft and fell apart. The one small cluster of snow crab legs we got was missing a leg. The corn was bland. The mussels weren't good, either. The garlic flavor leaned towards bitterness... The garlic bread was okay though. 

Also got the skillet paella. It mostly tasted like tomatoes, even with the seafood in it. The worst part was broken pieces of mussel shells were scattered throughout. Unappealing and unappetizing. Like the garlicky butter bake, the best part of the dish was the two pieces of garlic bread (which wasn't even that great).

We were actually here sometime last year and the food wasn't so bad then. I don't know if they changed chefs or what, but it's safe to say that we definitely won't be returning here anytime soon. 

I'm only giving two stars because service was pretty decent -even though they didn't ask us how our food was. I guess they already knew the answer.",0

"What a poorly run establishment. One of our entree's arrvied before the appetizer, I reminded the waitress 3 times that we were still waiting on an entree which still hadnt arrived after an hour and a half. I asked for the check, reviewed it and asked the waitress whether or not they felt they should do anything for us because the poor service. She took it to the owner who sent it back un changed with a different waitress. I let them know I would not be paying since i came to dinner expecting to get an entree and since I didnt get one that I would not be parying for dinner. I let them know that if they would  pay me for my time which was wasted and then I would pay for what I ate. They would not discuss. I walked out, they followed me to the parking lot and called the police. I would advise you to not waste your time with an establishment who clearly does not understand the service industry!",0
"I hate to be the bad news bear, but 3rd visit last night for dinner, and the food & service were both not the best.  I had the 3 veggies plate with mac & cheese, collard greens, and cream squash.  I also had a few bites of the fried pickles.  Fried pickles were good.  Mac & cheese was moist and cheesy and acceptable.  Collard greens was under cooked in my opinion and I have had better home cooked greens than that.  Cream squash was OMG kinda not good.  It was so watery, for a moment I thought I had ordered cream OF squash soup.  Waitress wasn't too friendly at all.  I doubt it's a surprise that it's going to be busy at dinner time, so why not put that frowny face away and put a freaking smile on!

Seriously, I'm getting tired of all the hypes floating around town about these hip new places.  So far I've been disappointed by most of them.",0
"The photos posted of the rooms are definitely NOT indicative of the room I stayed in except for the one of the broken electrical socket.  The plug for the tub didn't fit properly hence I couldn't take a bath, the electrical socket was broken and didn't seem to even work enough to charge my cell phone or the portable charger, there was bird poop all over the window of my room, there was food sitting outside the rooms next to mine from room service for the ENTIRE time I was there, and the breakfast buffet was bad.  The lettuce in the salad bar was wilted, the scrambled eggs were runny, the ""soup of the day"" wasn't labeled. It may have well been mystery soup as it had a creamy base but with random spinach like veggies and tasted a bit over salted. For the over all price I payed for both the room(almost $200 for a MONDAY til TUESDAY, 1 day stay), I could have stayed at a better kept or newer casino.  The last time I stayed at the Flamingo was probably about 15yrs ago and it was better kept back then than it was now...Maybe they spent all the gambling revenues towards the birds and fishes in the courtyard as there were only flamingos there the last time I stayed there.",0

Our room has a great view but it also has mascara and blue eyeshadow all over the bathroom floor. Obviously the floor was NOT CLEANED.

It's great gelato... but WAY over priced. I think I paid $6 for a single scoop of gelato. The most I've ever had to pay. I have to admit that it was really good though. Cocolini is located in the Venetian... appropriate I think. I guess they can really jack up the price cause it's vegas and people will pretty much pay no matter how expensive things are.,0

"I have given this place a try quite a few times during the past few years. I was just here as last resort because the other places in the area were closed on Sundays. It's not that I expect friendly service from the person working at the counter but when your place is named ""Aloha"" Kitchen, you'd think someone can crack a smile and say hi when they take your order.  It's just not one time, it's consistently like this, no greeting at all!   

The food is alright, I do give credit that they plate the food attractively, but they rely too much on drowning their meats in sauce for flavor instead of seasoning and marinating it.  The slices of beef that did have no sauce were a little dry & tasteless.  The manapua I ordered was a store bought brand and the dough was a bit tough. (like they left it cooking in the microwave a little too long) . That's probably why you get your food real quick!! It's already been prepared all they do is reheat it!  There are at least 3 other places that serve up better Hawaiian & Filipino food in the area so aloha, Aloha Kitchen.",0
"I do not know much about their services. Strange, I know, but let me explain.

I made an appointment on a Monday for this location (which is a good 30 minutes away) for the following Friday. Even though I was not sure it was going to be open (Friday was the day before a holiday), they told me they were and confirmed my appointment. 

That Friday I drove to the location and waited for the doors to unlock so I could take care of my bothersome cavity. 

I waited. And waited. And waited. Yes, you get the point.

Big surprise, they weren't open. Nobody had given me the courtesy to call, apologize for the scheduling mistake and reschedule. So instead of booking another dentist to take care of my increasingly painful cavity, I had to wait almost another week to get into a stellar dentist who confirms their appointments ahead of time and are very friendly.

P.S. 4 days after the missed/accidental appointment I received a call/voicemail stating that they got my message and if I was interested in still obtaining their service I could call X phone #. No apology. I didn't expect champagne, catered breakfast and a red carpet as I walked into the office, but a simple apology for THEIR mistake would have saved my business and resulted in more referrals. 

Sorry Absolute Dental. Fail.",0
"Hour wait even with reservations. We made 7:00pm reservations for a party of 2 and did not get seated until 8pm and that was after having to ask the host several times, and then finally for a manager. It took at least 15 minutes for the employees to find her. This location has just really gone down hill, I've been to many Benihanas throughout the country from locations in Atlanta, Detroit, San Diego, and this location is the absolute worst experience I've ever had at a Benihana's. It looked as if they were short staffed there were at least 4 grills that were not being used. One positive experience was our chef Joseph made the food delicious and of course entertaining. The manager did seem understanding and apologized and was willing to try and make our visit better. But, still will not be returning to this location.",0
"So if my experience wasn't bad before I went back with my receipt and the lady that helped us out at the fine jewelry was very nice, but when the manager came out she was the biggest bitch. She didn't show any concern for my horrible experience or the time wasted. Just said its policy shrugged her shoulders and walked away. Didn't say have a nice day or asked if there was anything else she could be assistance of. This managers name is Lynn. The gm of this location whose name is Chris will be getting a call as well. She needs to be aware of the poor customer service her employees are giving. Almost like I'm wasting their time after I have spent nearly 500$ there. I returned everything and went to Dillard's to buy the same exact items for the same price.",0
Food was terrible. Restaurant seemed to be big for happy hour as that area was packed. The dinning area we were in was old and dumpy looking. Food was ready within 5 minutes of ordering and tasted like it was reheated. Will not eat here again. Sad we wasted a night out here and money. Was not worth it. Worse than ramen noodles.,0
"Very slow more conversations amongst them selves than with customers. This location use to be very people friendly, that was another time.",0
"We ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery. Called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.  Delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese.  Horrible customer service.  If the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free.  Better yet, NEVER order from a pizza place that takes 2 hours to deliver!!!",0
"Don't recommend what so ever. So terrible, we tried to bring one of our friends to try pho for the first time and the service was terrible, we ordered a Thai tea Boba, the Boba was hard and the tea was too strong. It was so gross we didn't pay for it and we're not allowed back but I don't even care, I'm never gonna go back. It was just a waste of time. Don't go here, go up the street to pho Kim long they're pho is way better and cheaper.",0
"Well, I'm seriously underwhelmed.

It's not that the wings were bad -- it's just that the hype of ""the best in the city"" means they have a lot to live up to.  Couple that with their own hype machine of  ""our medium is VERY HOT"", the running competition of who can eat the most, etc, and really, I expect something better than a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.

What I got is a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.  Juicy meat, sure, but way too much sauce* left the wings soggy.  I want some crispness to my wings.  Were they tasty?  Sure.  Are they worth over a buck a wing?  I'm not so sure.  Factor in their overpriced crap-domestic beer and mediocre fries and I'm left with little reason to go out of my way to visit the place.  Anyway, on to specifics:

I call a huuuuuge BS on their heat claims.  If I had known how run of the mill their ""Hot"" was, I would have instead ordered ""Superhot"" or ""Death"".  As a consumer, I find that misleading and disappointing.   

I've been a hot aficionado since I was ten years old.  I feel more pain biting into a jalapeno (3500-8000 Scoville) than I did eating ten of their ""hot""... a jalapeno is practically a fruit!  I didn't even have to blow my nose or clear my throat, nor did I touch my beer until after the meal.

Listen, I get it, marketing is king... but c'mon.  At least try to back it up!  

I'm a bit sad to do it, but Duff's clocks in at an underachieving 2 stars.  Not only have I experienced better, I've also experienced hotter.

*  I am surely wrong, but I'd swear their ""hot"" sauce is Frank's Extra Hot mixed with butter.  It was that generic.",0
"They would get a much lower score if possible. If you are looking to visit a JITB, drive another mile and go to another one. I was appalled at the lack of service and the inaccuracy of the order. Sauces were left off a burrito, food was burned, incorrect condiments given, SLOW service, and a group of workers that could not get their act together. It is a dirty store outside (I went through the drive through). When I complained to JITB through their survey, they couldn't even get that right! Never again!",0
"Unfortunately this banks customer service is abismal anymore, my company has been banking with Pnc for probably 30-40 years at multiple locations and up until a few months ago we never had any issues but recently it is terrible. The tellers are rude to my employees most of the time and after an error that was their fault I spoke with the teller manager I believe her name is Brittany, who was incredibly unhelpful and rude. Now when my employees go there for daily business they aren't even greeted at the door now and the tellers are consistently unfriendly. Such a shame and difference from a few months ago when the staff was lovely and competent. Very unpleasant to do business here anymore. If you notice any positive reviews are from at least 2 years ago.",0
Fraudulent. Handy seems great. It was great. Until they removed their phone number from their app and the internet and started billing me for cleanings that I DID NOT BOOK OR RECEIVE. When you cancel the returning service they will still bill you and there is no way to contact them. They stopped responding to my emails by the way. I have wasted so much time with my credit card company about being repeatedly charged for services and they wont respond to my emails. The BBB and federal government needs to be involved in stopping this,0
Usually I have no problems at this location but a sassy little Hispanic young lady with too much makeup on had nothing but attitude.,0
Worst Chinese delivery I have ever got. Food arrived in a small bowl size for $12-$15 each. Delivery took 45min and had no sauce or utensils. Food was poorly seasoned and some vegetables were raw in stirfry.,0
I see another person on here had the same experience as me.....the wrong coffee in the wrong pot...lol...that cracks me up.....how hard can it be to put the coffee in the right pot....today I'm sitting here waiting to get my order...we will see if they get it right....well we got our food and of course they got it wrong again...lol...this place is something else I've never seen a resturant with a track record like this....I asked to see a manager and there isn't even one here. .lol...What a waste..,0
"Heard this was a good place for after ball game, or anytime for that matter.  prior to going to Cactus League game checked their website. They advertise daily happy hour  with $4 Margaritas + $3 well drinks, among other offers. 

My Margarita was $7 & well was $6. When I questioned this was told that during March no happy hour due to ball games as people still come in & that their website means nothing.
Great location, poor help, poor service & FALSE advertising. Wont go back!",0
"My boyfriend and I went here together to pick up lunch... Long story short, this is probably the worst location. My boyfriend ordered a sandwich and didn't get the bread or strawberry. I ordered a salad and soup and they somehow forgot to include dressing in my meal. Save your money and time by going to the location on Lake Mead. They have better service, staff, and they've never made mistakes when serving meals--even when they're overwhelmed and packed with customers! Such a shame that this location couldn't measure up... huge fan of Zupas.",0
This office is so unorganized. I've been here coming here now for about 6 month. But today was the worst. I have to drive 45 minutes to get to this office. So then when I get there you have to get this card before you can get your shot. So they tell me we're sorry we are out of cards. Ok... Then when shot lady calls me up for my turn (had to wait an hour just for that) i procede to tell her that the lady at the front said that they ran out of cards. Of course she's like you need a card. Maybe you should do something so you don't run out. Then on top of that I tell her that my asthma and allergies have been really bad this week. So she's like I can't give you your shot. Wow!! So I ask them could you ask the doctor if he could maybe prescribe some predisone because I'm having a hard time breathing and my inhalers are having no affect. So surprise surprise they can't do that either. You have to make an appointment for that. Wich of course will be like a month out. Now I have to suffer. Thanks for nothing!,0
"The food just didn't have any flavor.  And now my stomach hurts.  The guy that took my order was lovely, the delivery guy (possibly same guy) was very sweet.  It's just that the food has no flavor.  Also the apps were burned.  I mean I'm definitely not hungry now, but I could have accomplished that for less than $45 (three people ordering entrees and two starters).  I won't be ordering from there again.  I heard good things about this place, but I'm just becoming more convinced good Chinese food in Phoenix (or Arizona) doesn't exist.",0
"My food was made totally wrong, I was very specific in what I wanted and he just said ya ya ok and brought it out per the menu.  Overall was really pricey for mexian food, I should have listened to the other reviews!

However, the Mirachi band was fantastic!",0
"I took my car to Ganley Lincoln service department to try and find out why horrible gasoline/raw gas odor were entering the cabin of my car, likely coming in through the HVAC system.  I suspected a likely fuel leak somewhere near the firewall but could not locate one.   I took my car to Ganley  Lincoln Service Dept. and paid the $129 diagnostic fee (steep!).  Service advisor Beth P called to inform that I needed $1900 in repairs as the exhaust manifold gaskets were leaking and had a bad seal. Yikes!!   Keep in mind this is a 2007 Lincoln Town Town in meticulous condition, always garaged, and only 65,000 miles and has barely been driving in winter.

 I was quoted $500 a side for new exhaust manifolds and bolts at another service facility.  However,  the mechanic of 20 years said he has never seen a town car or crown vic needing new exhaust manifolds at 65,000 miles.   He did some further research and discovered the left rear cylinder spark plug was not seated properly and only needed to be rethreaded.  Total cost was $75 for retap and INCLUDED his diagnostic time as well.   Problem was fixed!!!

I know enough about engines as well to realize that $1900 sounded sky high and didn't think the new manifolds solution sounded correct.  Good thing I went with my gut and got a second opinion.   I would have been out $2000 in repairs and the problem would not have been corrected!   Stay away from this service department.   Far far away... unless you don't mind paying $2000 for repairs you don't need!",0
"Poor service. I ordered something to go. When I received my order it was wrong. The young lady proceeded to tell me I ordered wrong. They attempted to correct my order by not making a new one and adding regrilling what was messed up. After paying $20, I then had to pay $1 more dollar for salsa. WOW. Food tasted less than average.",0
The food looked like it was prepared in old grease and had a taste to match. Wings and fries were over cooked and dry. It's cheap but you definitely get what you pay for. I won't ever be back. I would rather not eat at all.,0
The attendant stopped preparing our order for a customer that just walked in. Not impressed with the donuts and the boba. It tasted like chalk.,0
"Snooty staff. Was deeply offended by the horrible service we received. Hostess was arrogant and made statements like, ""we are usually a reservations only restaurant, you are lucky we can for you in at all.""

Not sure how she even had a job with an attitude like that. When I asked to speak to a manager she said no-one was available. Then some guy came up and claimed to be the manager's without even taking the time to respond to my complaints of bad service all he had to say was that a table was available. He was not truthful, however. No table  was available.

We left before we were seated. Won't be back. There's a better greek restaurant down the road with significantly better service.",0
"This place is packed and the rounds take over 5 1/2 hours.  They do a good job of marketing, too good.  So that all the hackers and everyone under the sun show up.  I have no problems with hacking since we've all been there.  I do have a problem with no marshal regulating play, the starter not effectively staggering tee offs and people so drunk they can't even stand on their own two feet.  

Consider this place a really pristine muni course, actually you're probably better off at 
a muni course

This was a weekday, I heard weekends are a joke",0
Beautiful grounds. Friendly staff. Average beds. Uncomfortable bedding and FLAT pillows resulting in terrible sleep. I expect more from such an expensive and beautiful hotel. Seems no thought was put in to offering pillow options for different sleepers. Won't come back.,0
"New image nail salon should rename themselves rushed low quality nail salon. This was my first time here. I came in with high expectations based on reviews from other Yelp users. Not sure if this was a one-off occurrence but my experience can best be summed up as terrible at best. 

When I arrived for my appointment on a Sunday, the owner (Wendy) was pre-occupied sorting out staffing issues, as apparently one of the girls working that day was not feeling well and had to go home. I waited probably 20 minutes before Wendy finished sorting out staffing issues and started on my nails. Everything was extremely rushed as she was the only one working on a Sunday. Even during the manicure her mind was elsewhere - constantly having to stop to pick up the phone, attending 2 other customers who were waiting the entire time I was getting my manicure. The end result, not surprisingly, was bleeding cuticles and botched, uneven coat, and poorly shaped nails. I let her know that one of my nails top coat created a drop that protruded from the polish,  and instead of filing it down and starting over she hastily filed it and applied another coat...what a joke.  To make the experience even worse, I observed the girl who was there before me come back to complain how her nails were ruined bc they had let her go before it was dry, goes to show quality is a clearly lacking aspect here. So in conclusion, the owner needs to figure out her staffing issues, focus on quality (which is quite lacking), and be less greedy (meaning not accepting more customers on the day when you don't have the capacity). I for one will never come back here again. 

P.S. Be wary, for some reason all of the negative reviews are hidden under ""Not recommended"" section of Yelp resulting in an inflated rating.",0
"Definitely not.  Unskilled, unprofessional, not craftsman like skills, did not tidy up.  Ripped us off - took our money and then filed bankruptcy.  Check out public records.   Shabby.",0
"I went here on Saturday for the breakfast special but turns out it's only available on the weekdays, fair enough. So I went again on a Wednesday around 7:20am and it was not even open yet. I saw 2 other cars waiting outside but I just left right after I saw there no lights on and no staff inside. That's ridiculous.. they must have some irresponsible staff working there.",0
A few of their classes are good. Run down equipment and the weights in the fitness room are falling apart. What really set me over the edge was them cancelling their body pump. Les Mills classes cost gyms money to keep certified and I'm concerned the gym is facing money problems. I'm all for small businesses and all but I had to be done.,0
"I have been here several times. One time, they got me mixed up with another patient (don't know how because my name is so unique) so they treated me according to the other patient's condition and did not discharge me for an extra 3 hours because they had to get everything straightened out. I was told that my description of symptoms was ""wrong and not possible"" by a woman who never introduced herself, so I am not sure if she was a doctor or if she even worked there. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! They also gave me a handout for high blood pressure because according to them, 110/70 is too high. Completely incompetent people working here and I will not return even if I am dying because I will never put my life in their hands again.",0

"We shop at smiths all the time, we enjoy the value and quality of products we receive from this establishment....  How ever at first I could not remember why we stop shopping at this particular location until today..... The staff needs to undergo hospitality course.... everyone at this location are extremely rude to customers, (from the customer service counter, cashiers, floor staff, and manager)..... The Manager- the main staff member that's suppose to set an example (I wanted to talk to him about the rudeness of his staff), when I over heard him yelling at the cashier (who went to retrieve him for me) stating their in a staff meeting and then slammed the door in the associate's face...... I walked out and said never again, I am done I have no respect for this location at all !!!!!!!!!!!!! Shopping here is not that serious... I refuse to be disrespected being a patron !!!!!!!!!!!!

"would give negative stars.

towed my car here from another incompetent mechanic. took them 2 months to even touch my car. parts were missing/broken. car still not running in fact is in worse condition than it was before.

"The artwork is great.  Very striking and captivating images that seemingly pop out of the frames with the vibrant  hues and colors.

The studio and it's salesmanship/service is decidedly less than impressive.   I ordered two pieces, Gorillas in The Mist and Tree of Truth.  The original art dealer who made our transaction was let go for untold reasons and was replaced by someone else(Mike?).   I only know this because I called to get a follwup on the delivery of the photographs because I have yet to hear from the guy who took over the account.  I think if someone took over the account, they should be taking the initiative to notify the customers of that change.  I basically had been getting no response from the emails I sent to my original dealer, and I had to call to find out what happened.

About four weeks later, I received the Tree of Trurth(alternatively called Wisdom Tree).  However, it was only by accident that I received it.  I stopped by my local USPS office to pick up an article by another merchant, and to my surprise the clerk brought me a package from the Rodney Lough Studio.  I have no idea how  long it had been at the USPS office, because I was never notified by Mike, or frankly anyone from this Las Vegas studio that the piece had been shipped out.  I wasn't notified by USPS either, but we all know and expect crappy service from the USPS - the main difference is that I didn't pay USPS thousands of dollars for a certain level of service.  

I am left wondering:

If Rodney Lough Jr. Sells their pieces of artwork as being something of value and something to treasure...Why would they send it via the UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE like its junk mail?? Why not give the customer at least an email notification that it has been sent out???

I wonder if the people at the Peter Lik galleries provide better customer service?  Something that extends beyond the swipe of the credit card?  

I am glad the Wisdom Tree was not lost or damaged in the USPS office, but I certainly expected better service than I have received.  Still waiting on the Gorillas in the Mist....hopefully it will be delivered to my door like they originally promised, and not by USPS.",0
"To the young lady working last night with no name tag on, speak up, speak clearly, do not walk away from a sick, tired costumer. If you were having a bad night, ok, but your behavior was unacceptable.

Pharmacist - thanks for pointing out I was right about being allergic to the meds the urgent care prescribed. Good call.",0
"The sign says they open at 7am, but apparently they overslept today hahaha. Two stars for sleeping in!",0
"You know, for the price, this isn't a dump.  If you're looking for something cheap and acceptable, this is it.  However, what I really didn't like was the deception.  That's why I'm dinging them down to two stars.

I booked this through expedia, and the Website clearly stated that there were no resort fees, just $45 total for two weeknights.  Okay, no resort fees.  So on check-in, I asked what the final rate would be.

""We can't tell you, because you booked this through expedia,"" she said.  ""They don't give us any numbers.""

Okay, all right.

Then upon checkout, they charge a $20.22 resort fee for two nights.  WTF?!  That brought the total for two nights up to $65.  Okay, so that's still a good rate.  But why deceive us?

This is an old hotel, and it shows.  It didn't disgust me.  The room was clean.  There were some small problems.  I had a problem with the shower when it suddenly went cold on me.  And for some reason, they don't put blankets on the beds, only sheets, and it took me a couple hours to figure out how to turn down the A/C.  Small things.

But hey, they had free wifi and all the cable I could consume.  I felt safe in the parking lot because they have some pretty strict guards making sure that everybody who comes into the lot has a room key.  So I used the El Cortez as home base to do business away from downtown.

When I did stay downtown, it was fine.  At 2 am, I saw a couple hookers, and even one walking into the hotel, but during the day, it was nice to take a stroll down the Fremont Experience, which is just a block away.",0
"Really disliked this place.
1. Nobody greeted us as we came in 
2. When we were standing in line there were 2 ladies at the front desk, we stood in front of the one that was clearly doing nothing but sitting and starring at a computer and when we approached her she looked up at us and said nothing and went back on the computer. Not even a "" somebody will be right with you"" 
3. Out of a few staff 2 people (the lady who cashed us in and the gentlemen that told us the rules) were nice 
4. We were probably the only people in here and staff kept following us around didn't let us jump in peace.

"Went here today arrived at 7:00pm I had my order in by 7:10 didn't get my food until an hour later I'm typing as I wait to 7:58pm. It does not take an hour to make a burger. It was not even busy. The server was nice but the place STANK, disgusting. Never coming again.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE",0
"This is quite possibly the worst drive-thru. If you have 30 minutes to wait for your fast food to come out, this place is just for you.",0
I have been to this location multiple times and although there front staff is friendly the wait times are between 45 to 120 minutes with an appointment.   It is unacceptable to expect patients to wait around this long. I would recommend going anywhere else for your imaging.,0
"i've had better. it is really nothing special, but you could not tell that from how crowded the place got after i sat down in my booth. 

the burgers were on the thin side, but the fries were really good. i ended up eating all of my fries and my friend's when he wasn't looking. 

i ordered a milkshake, but it really was not a milkshake at all. it was a soft serve ice cream with hershey syrup frozen drink disguised as a milkshake. how can you do that and call it a milkshake, i will never fully understand?

so either i was really hungry after spending the day at hoover dam or it was actually a decent meal. i think i was just hungry. the jury is still out on that one.",0
"I've had better. I come from the Bay Area where Asian buffets come a dime a dozen. My BF raved about this place and being a sushi lover, I of course had to try it!
We went for lunch after doing some shopping and we were seated very quickly. Selection wasn't as good as I had hoped for and they didn't have signs listing what kind of sushi you were eating so you were in the dark. The beef terriyaki was good and I ended up eating mostly that.
So why the 2 stars? Why not 3? Because my stomach was not happy - AT ALL - an hour after we left.",0

"Totally rudeee the lady who answered the phone didn't say thank you for calling frenzy how can I assist you, she just answers the phone saying ""hello"" in a harsh Tone. I then asked her is this frenzy?? She says yes, I said OK where are you guys located and she says in Las Vegas. Rather then her giving me the actual address that is what she  answered. She Saw an out of town number and obviously thought that I wasn't in town... she then says I'm placing you on hold, so I told her don't bother!! Her service was completely rude and very unprofessional. If you were trying to run a boutique and actually get sales I think your customer service skills need to be highly corrected. Service in Las Vegas sucks!!!",0

We walked in and it took a full 2 minutes for the hostess to finish her conversation of gossip with a waitress before even acknowledging us. Then proceeds to tell my husband and I the wait is 35 minutes.   That kind of wait at 7:30 on a Thursday tells me they are not efficient. Not sure if I will return",0

"Aaliyah at the restaurant was super rude . Maybe bc it was myself and my sister - two girls - but she was short , rude, did not smile a bit . We were asking questions about the drinks and menu, and she blank stared us and didn't offer and information. We ordered drinks and water with our food . She never came back . We asked another waitress after 20 minutes . We finally got water and then our drinks . The food was ok- but the service by far made it to where I won't go back",0

"I decided to swing by to buy a few medium sized mid priced cigars since I live around the corner. I spent $15 on 3 cigars. Sad to say that even though the cigars were kept in a cabinet humidor that they were dry as a bone when I got them home. I smoked one about 10 minutes after buying it and while cutting the cigar it crunched and practically shattered. After lighting up the cigar the wrapper flaked off, it burned incredibly hot and unevenly and was so bitter that I couldn't finish it. Too bad since they are so close to home, but I'll be traveling elsewhere from now on.",0
"As a vegan I am pretty good at finding great food on menus at non vegan restaurants.  I was super disappointed last night when ordering the vegetable fajitas to find out you use butter to grill your vegetables and you put milk in your tortillas.  The waitress, who was super at her job, was only able to offer me a salad.  She said there wasn't any vegetable based oil in the kitchen to grill my vegetables.  Super frustrated for myself but the rest of the party really loved their non vegan choices and they will definitely be back.  Me, not so much.",0
"My first visit here, I came for lunch with friends and it was packed.  This place kind of reminded me of Panera Bread, but with more choices and a little bit cheaper.  They only took half my order because you order soup/ salad first then down the line you can order soup.  They got my sandwich order, but completely overlooked me and went to the person behind me,  I did manage to squeeze in my soup order (I was going for the pick 2). 

My other friend was successful in placing both his orders, but his sandwich never came down to the cashier. Then they said they will bring it out to him and it took almost 15 minutes even when he went back to ask them what happen to his sandwich.

When it came to finding a table, the empty ones were dirty with no one in sight to clean or wipe off the table.  I had to go to the cashier to ask them to send someone or give me a towel to wipe it off.  

I did enjoy my turkey spinach artichoke panini sandwich though.",0

"Went for the first time today. Ordered two burgers, two shakes and an order of the tempura green beans. The burgers where ok at best. Meat was good but the buns where so burnt and smashed down, making them super hard. Half way through the burger we both got tired of eating it and tossed the buns in the garbage. Tried letting management know about my experience but no one ever picks up. Shakes and green beans where good. I'll try them again sometime but so far I'm not impressed at all.",0
"This is the first one star I have ever given on yelp, mainly because there are usually redeeming qualities to any establishment or business. NOT this one, avoid it like the plague. The Older Indian lady there is by far one of the most defensive and rude individuals I have ever encountered.

Charged 3 dollars for using email to download a file 
Black and white machine broke down so forced to print in color with no discounts.
Stays on the phone out of site for 3 minutes while I wait to pay the outrageous charge of 3 color pages for 5 dollars 
Proceeds to ignore me in sight while still on the phone not coming to work the cashier

"horrible.   Never again.  I booked this through the airline  (Allegiant). waiting no less than 50 minutes so far and no hope of the shuttle in sight.  I've seen a one driver go by twice, we still wait.  I came to Vegas for some much needed R&R.  So far I can't get away from the airport.  Call Uber, probably about the same pride.  Never again for this outfit.",0
"The worst hotel experience I've EVER had on the strip. I am a local and was looking for a place to take my nephew, that had a great pool, for a little staycation. First, when we walked into our room all lights were unplugged and we had find our way in the dark. Then we noticed a poorly patched up hole in the wall, all the furniture was dusty and old, the bathroom was very outdated with scratched, peeling cabinets and the sink didn't even drain. Because we were only there for a quick night, we chalked it up to being an old hotel. But then, the next morning, we found bed bugs in our bed. When we called the front desk and it took four phone calls and an hour and half wait time for he security guard to come to our room to make a report. After the report, we had to go down stairs where we were rudely helped by the front desk and then had to wait another hour to speak to the manager.  The manger was nice, but couldn't help us, all he did was give us a card of another manager and told him to contact him in a couple days. We spent the rest of the day in the pool, which was very small and crowded for families as they have cut off 3/4 of their pool (the main reason we chose the Flamingo) to accommodate their go-pool (adults only) which I can understand, it is vegas, but they took away their lounge chairs around the slide pool (where my kids wanted to spend all of their time) so we had to sit on the hot concrete. Overall, this was the worst experience I've ever had in a hotel, I will NEVER stay at the flamingo again or even visit it.",0
"1st Visit: Took order home - Donuts stale
2nd Visit: Entered store with intention to make sure donuts were fresh, but no counter person in sight; rather friendly, loud conversation from back of store - Waited for a bit and then left. Kidding around in the back apparently more important than selling product.
3rd Visit: Counter person busy with coffee machine, didn't acknowledge customer. Continued with a more important activity going from one side of store to the other complaining that the steamer didn't work. Another case of ignore the customer.
Summary: 3rd visit was last visit; doubtful that I'll bother with Dunkin' again.",0
"Just ok.  I had the roast beef sandwich which was ok, but a little salty.
Also tried the Ahi salad sandwhich which was a grilled butter bomb.  And tasteless.
Salad was good.
Ribs were OK, nothing special.
Koloa Pork was soaked and oozing in BBQ sauce.  What?  That's not Koloa Pork!  Awful.

The Tilapia taco whatevers as an appetizer were ok, but needed more zing.  

Service was nice enough, but didn't seem like she cared or had any passion.  
good beer was enjoyed though!",0
"Maybe it was just a bad night that I went. 

My friends and I went to this hot pot place last week to 1) warm ourselves up, 2) cheapest one in the area. It seemed like an optimal place with bubble tea and billards downstairs. When we entered, there was only 2 tables occupied. We went at approximately 8pm so we thought maybe we missed the dinner rush (I don't think that ever happened). 

We stood around for 5 minutes since no one was there...then a girl came out and escorted us to our table. The service overall wasn't good at all. When we were paying, I think the girl made a mistake so she kept on swearing to herself and didn't give a crap about us paying. 

Food wise, it was alright. Not the best I've had (given it was only for $18), it was decent. I wouldn't necessarily come back to this place again given the shitty service.",0
"We stopped here for lunch yesterday (8/23/14).  We were seated in a booth, and waited for our server.  After about 10 minutes, a young woman came by and said ""I'll be right back"".  Then she proceeded to go to the hostess stand, look at something, stand there awhile; when the hostess came back, she started a conversation with her - and never even acknowledging us again.  Not even a glass of water.  We waited at least 20 minutes for something to happen (and they were not crowded, there were only about 10-12 tables filled in the entire restaurant).  Finally, since she decided her conversation was more important, we left.  She saw us leave (after all, she was conversing with the hostess) and didn't even apologize.  There is no excuse for bad service in ANY restaurant.  Guess there wasn't a manager on duty to monitor.",0
Very fun atmosphere they do have the best fried chicken with wasabi mayo. I had their ramen noodles. Lacking in flavor and their pork belly could have been better. Best ramen so far is Ippodu in NYC.,0
"Wife and I have been going to Abuelos for years, so when we feel like Mexican food there was no other place we considered. We like it so much we drive out of our way to eat there. We frequent Abuelos where ever we find them including but not limited Phoenix, Chandler and Kansas City MO. 

So for my wife and I to give a 1 star should hopefully get the attention of the owners. We were extremely disappointed with the food and lack of service during our last few visits to the Chandler location. I would bet on it that the management were not there yesterday during our visit because there was a lack luster attention to service period. 

We arrived at 330pm, to find 3 seated tables and a bunch of staff some making eye contact with us as we stood there waiting to be seated. As we stood in the lobby waiting to be seated for 10mins, I turned around to walk out before my wife waved down a waiter who noticed us when we first walked in to seat us. The host was no where to be found but did show as the waiter grabbed the menus. Out of the corner of my eye the host gave our waiter a dirty look, yes I did see that rudeness coming from the host with long black hair. I'm kinda glad someone decided to do her job. But after the food and service, I should have went with my gut feeling and walked out. After all, going to eat at the odd hour has its chance of being served leftover dried out food, but I felt Abuelos was a different place to eat, NOT SO.  


The Pasta La Paz my favorite was lacking sauce, the chicken was dried up leftovers from lunch and had been placed under the salamander to heat then left on the counter to cool to less than room temp when served. My wife's fajitas tacos where not fajita stips but chopped up leftover beef from the lunch. 

We pushed out empty drink glasses to the edge of the table for refills which finally got filled after 15mins. We could not wait to get out of there, we are so disappointed since we loved this place so much. 

We started noticing this on the last few visits, when we have ate there during off hours. Sadly,  I won't spend another $40 to find out if they have change, that was our purpose for our recent visit. We enjoyed our multiple monthly visits to Abuelos, but that will not be the case any longer. 

Hope this helps improve on what once was a great experiences for us.",0
"I will never rented from them.
My friend lost the key in the car and we were locked out of the car.
I called them but they let us wait for 2 hours and just transfer a key company.
That company required us a annual fee for one time unlocked.
Finally, we ended up to talk hotel and they called a local key company.

Also, we made reservation a middle car for $120, but last day, they required $210 which include insurance.
Even when I called for unlocking key, they said we do not have insurance.
Be careful about total fee and I do not recommend ask them to rent a car.",0
"So this place just earned themselves a 1-star update, and it's a complete shame too. Service was always good to adequate, and I looked past that because of the food, but tonight was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. 

First, the gal who seated us puts us right next to the kitchen entrance in the dining area, the noisiest booth in the entire restaurant, even though the place was 1/2 empty at the time. Nothing like having to repeat yourself to your dinner date every-other-sentence because people in back are continually dropping off piles of plates and smashing things together and, generally, making enough racket to wake the dead. Someone finally brings chips and salsa, but we've still got no drinks and no server. I guess I'm supposed to take it down dry, right? Eventually someone shows up and we get our drink order in. No apology for the wait, naturally. 

After waiting slightly more than usual, our entrees come out. We went to town, all the while consciously saving room for some dessert (sopapillas for the win, right?). To her credit, the server did check on us to ensure the food was ok, albeit not until we had about half way finished the meal. Had there been a problem, it would have been a long wait. I know what you're thinking at this point. You're asking yourself what the big deal was and how this was some service disaster. In fairness, I didn't see it coming either, but stick with me for a bit longer!

So with our entrees done, as in pushed away, covered with a napkin, cutlery crossed on the plate, we began our anxious wait for the sopapillas. The first step was ordering them, which when the server finally came to collect the plates (also after too long) we did. And so begins the waiting game without end. 

At 10 minutes in, still to sopapillas, but I counted up to 6 different staffers, including at least one manager, futzing with the tables next to us. Talking while standing right next to us, as if the plate dropping, chair moving, table dragging was not enough. There's nothing like trying to sit in silence at the table while having some chic's rear end inches from your face while she and some other mental midget try to figure out if they have enough chairs. Between all these people, they still managed to put more plates on the table than they had chairs. While this is going on, a woman walked up to one of them and said she needed a server. She described him physically, with enough detail to pick him up out of a police lineup (age, height, hair color, glasses.. seriously!) and someone went looking for him while she returned grumpily to her table. 

We're now 15 minutes in. Still no sopapillas. Futzing with the table is continuing, but then suddenly the manager and staffers helping with this decide on a new plan. Each table and all the chairs are slowly, noisily moved to the other side of the dining area. That's right, all the racket and hassle was for naught. Still no sign of our server or our dessert. A chip guy comes by and asks us if we want more chips, mistaking us for someone that just got seated. I explain we would like the dessert we ordered and asked if he could help figure out what happened. He leaves, never to be seen again. 

At the 20 minute mark, a completely different chip guy wanders up and asks if we'd like more chips. I tell him about the ordeal and previous chip guy and tell him to get a manager so we can get our bill and leave, because we don't want the dessert anymore. He obliges. While we're waiting, we get another red flag. Remember the woman who was trying to track down her server? Yeah so she wanders up to the area behind the fountain, where the kitchen entrance is, just beneath the ""Employees Only"" sign. This lady literally yells, while waving her arms, ""We need a server out here!"" Wow. O.o

At the 25 minute mark, chip guy #2 came through and a manager arrived at our table. Clearly no clue what the problem was, he opens with the standard, ""Is there a problem?"" line. I explain our ordeal and he asks me who the server was, and of course I don't recall her name (he's the manager, shouldn't he know who is serving this table?). I told him I don't want the dessert, just bring the bill. A few moments later he returns will the bill, sans sopapillas, and apologizes. Nothing else was comped, naturally. 

About 5 minutes later, our server shows up with sopapillas and a backhanded apology. See, she goes on about how she asked someone else to help out and take care of us. It's your table, you own the service. If you entrust our care to some brain donor who drops the ball, it's still on you. She cashed us out and we walked out, leaving less than 10% for the tip and all the sopapillas behind. We didn't touch them for two reasons. 1) On principle, as we said we no longer wanted them and 2) They looked disgusting, long and skinny, darker than usual color and just.. wrong.

I'm sorry but how do you manage to screw it up this bad? What a complete and utter farce.",0

If you lost your ass and hungry ass a homeless person.... this is the place for you! The selection and quality is absolutely horrible. I would not go back to this dump if it were $4.99.,0
I have nothing good to say about The inner sleeve. I am very disgusted and a little pissed off. I brought some records and a turntable in to see what they were worth and the person behind the counter said everything i had was very common and not worth anything accept for 2 records that  were worth 5 DOLLARS the rest was worthless. I agree that what i brought in were not great records but to say and do that is not nice or a fair price which is stated on there web site. The turntable was working accept the belt for the turntable was broken and the person said it would cost 30 DOLLARS to fix WTF!!! What is the belt made of special rubber !! That some special belt in conclusion i will not ever do business with this establish again and for those who do you are fools. I understand they are there to make money that's fine i am all for that but it is how you do it that makes you a good establishment what you said and did to me was not nice or fair. I did go to your all you can carry once and what a load of crap you had if it wasn't for the Montovani and Nana Mouskouri records you would have had very little to offer.The record i brought in will be amongst next years all you can carry. I did get 10 record sleeves for my trouble and WTF should i support you for something that cost maybe 10 cents a for a piece plastic no thanks. All i am talking about is goodwill if you don't have that you might as well fold up your business and close your doors.,0
"I'm being generous to give this place 1 star. The service was ok. We went in with greater expectations only to be disappointed. We stopped in for cocktails and appetizers and were shocked to find that the specialty cocktails are served in plastic cups-a Margarita in a cup? ( Really?! I thought this was a restaurant, but a pool party!) We ordered Drunken Shrimp and Guacamole and chips. The shrimp looked like something you use as bait for bigger shrimp; it wasn't peeled and was overloaded with heat, not spice or flavor. The Guacamole tasted prepackaged or something from Costco. The venue was typical-TV's playing 80's Rock videos were okay, but not of high quality. If you are looking for a better rock-and-roll venue, go to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.",0

"I had explicitly explained to your manager that 1) I didn't receive an email - so I didn't see this fine print that you speak of; 2) I'm in the process of relocation, so I don't have my license transferred to NV and still work in both NV and CA.

Maybe the reason you boast not being a crowded gym is that you won't let anyone use your facility without these crazy conditions that I and others speak of in reviews...

Additionally, you have one shower stall with a huge rainfall shower head; not everyone wants to have water falling directly on their head and no where else...

Anyway, thank you to the GM for being such a jerk; this allowed for me to see that there is no flexibility whenever there is an issue that may arise with your patrons. The reason I signed with 24? Their staff was understanding of my situation and totally accommodating.  Yay for them - love them!!!",0

"We had done a reservation and no one ever told us that the main street to get to the restaurant was closed for a parade. Drove 45 minutes just to be told by a police officer at a barricade that the road was inaccessible and we needed to park our vehicle 2 kilometers away if we wanted to get to our destination. Tried calling the restaurant but no one ever picked up the call. Some 30 minutes later, on our way back home, some lady called to ask if we were still planing on showing up. I explained what had happened and she didn't bother doing or proposing anything because of their mistake. Bad customer service. Shame on you people. No sense of business relationships. 

NEVER AGAIN!!!",0

"I had over $2000 worth of work done on my car here 2 years ago.  Tint job, and car audio installation were the two major things I had worked on at this shop.  I have an older car with the dot matrix at the top of the back window for the defroster.  I don't know much about tinting, so I didn't know that it would like shit when trying to tint over the dot matrix.  I go to pickup my car that night, and was told by the owner - ""Don't worry it just has to set, and then it won't show any more.""  I ask how long, and am told about a week.  A week goes by and it looks exactly the same.  I bring it back, and the story changes.  ""Oh, it's the dot matrix at the top..it can't be helped, that's just the way it turns out.  I'll have my installer use a heat gun, press it out and see if we can get it to look better.""  It actually looks much worse after all is said and done.  I have no complaints about the tinting on the other windows....except.   When I originally went to pickup my car after the initial installation the owner was working on another car where the owner blamed him for the window getting jammed up and coming off track after getting his tint done.   Ironically my passenger side window went off track a week or so after getting work done here, and it scratched up my newly installed tint.  The owner said it wasn't his fault, and they would not replace the tint.  

Now to the car audio installation.  The installation looks clean.  I have had no problems with the way it looks.   However I was sold on having the steering wheel controller installed.  (controls the volume and FF/RW tracks on the steering wheel).  He was unable to get it to work, and instead of offering a refund (89.99) I was told it was my problem, and I had to go to the dealership to fix the steering wheel control?  So I'm out 89.99!  The original subwoofer that was installed, blew out after a year.  It has a year warranty, so I was able to get a replacement subwoofer at no charge - BUT he charged me $35 to cover the shipping cost of the subwoofer to his shop.  I ended up paying it...hoping that would be the last of it.  NOPE, 11 months later, the subwoofer blows again...I call the shop this morning, and leave a message to have the owner call me.  No call as of yet, and I probably won't expect to get one.  I've also emailed about some other issues in the past, and never got a response.  Mind you - I did get a response when it was about buying new products, but got very minimal feedback when having to have a problem addressed. 

Needless to say - I'm done with this shop.  I'll take my hard earned money, and business elsewhere.  Besides - I don't want to pay another $35 for another subwoofer to get shipped.  That would be $70, and it will probably blow again, in another year - at which point I would be paying the cost for a new subwoofer anyway, and wasting more time, for a business that obviously doesn't care to retain their clients.",0
"This place is aweful. I got a drink and sandwich and didn't even walk out with a drink. I was on a hurry and the lady didn't give it to me.

"I was excited about this place. It has so much potential but like a lot of places in downtown Cleveland, the administration ruins everything. Sunday wad their first Sunday Funday... there was nobody there and they had nothing from the menu...like they didn't prepare for it at all.

Lastly, besides not having anything available to eat and not sure if they had enough ingredients for their drinks during their first Sunday ""party""... they published the event as ""beach casual look"". However, the hosts were all wearing Sathurday night club type dresses (early afternoon on Sunday!!) which was totally ridiculous. They also looked at us weird because we were wearing shorts... eehh... beach casual? They totally failed on planing in so many different ways.

If you want to stay upscale you may have to deliver on the simple things first. I hope they get better over time but I see this as another ""Tomo Sushi"" type situation. Great concept and poor execution.",0

I can understand getting busy, but why would anybody even want a pizza that's been sitting there for more than 2 hrs?! And we're less than 5 miles down Durango from them. The food is decent, but we won't be ordering from them again. Don't waste your time.",0
"Totally rudeee the lady who answered the phone didn't say thank you for calling frenzy how can I assist you, she just answers the phone saying ""hello"" in a harsh Tone.

She Saw an out of town number and obviously thought that I wasn't in town... she then says I'm placing you on hold, so I told her don't bother!! Her service was completely rude and very unprofessional. If you were trying to run a boutique and actually get sales I think your customer service skills need to be highly corrected.

Service was unbelievably slow. There was one other table in the restaurant and it took over a half hour to get out me food and took the server over ten min to come to the table for drinks.

"My friends and I were very excited to have brunch in a nice French restaurant while in Las Vegas. However, our experience was quite disappointing.

The 20 minute wait to be seated was completely reasonable. But the 20 minute wait to get our order taken and then the 40 minutes it took them to prepare 2 sandwiches, a bowl of soup, and one pastry is unspeakable for such a high-end restaurant. We were wondering what took them so long to prepare our food and then realized it was so they could turn a ""medium rare"" steak sandwich into an overcooked piece of wood. We probably would have sent it back, but it would have taken another 40 minutes and we were very hungry by that point.

Our waitress did not offer much detail or information about the menu to our group, which was clearly not well-versed in French. She was also very slow to refill our water glasses, and when she did, the water was lukewarm. I was wondering if this was a French thing, but saw that other tables were offered pitchers of ice water.

Glad I decided to eat an egg and cheese biscuit in the Venetian food court before heading up and waiting an hour to eat a $10 cup of soup in Bouchon.",0

"Pros

The Flamingo in Las Vegas is in a convenient location on the strip a stone's throw from some of the major casinos and resorts. The staff is extremely professional and amicable. We dealt with Brian at the front desk and Jeanette in guest services both of whom were friendly.

Cons

Despite it's nice location, the room itself was rather gross. To start, the rates online were different than those that we paid. We wanted to pay in cash so we figured we would be better off making the reservation in person. After watching 3 desk agents get up and never come back there was a crowd full of people with only 2 staff members present. After finally making it to the front after 35 or 40 minutes the rates that we ended up paying were not those online but we were both so tired it wasn't even worth bringing up. Five minutes after putting our bags down we realized we made a mistake booking the hotel and wish we had only paid for one night upfront instead of two. There were black stains on the white shower curtain, hairs on the ceiling, mildew in the shower, no fan in the bathroom, no towel hooks in the wall and nicks on the wall. I was looking forward to taking a bath upon arrival but as soon as I saw the tub I knew I would wait until I went back home. Some of the appliances in the room were unplugged forcing us to move the furniture to plug it in ourselves. The sheets were coming off the bed and continued to do so for the rest of our stay. In terms of the WiFi, it was decent but on the slow end and only allowed for 2 devices to be connected at once. The room did not come with a refrigerator or microwave and if we wanted a fridge it was an additional $15 per night not including taxes. There was a constant and unpleasant odor that permeated throughout our room for the 2 nights we stayed. The walls are rather thin so when the people staying to the left of us were in their room we could actually hear the conversation clearly...from our bed...across the room. To top it off the air conditioner was extremely loud and rather irritating. The pools were alright. The pool for those over 21 looked fun but busy while the beach club pool was extremely overcrowded. We left before we even sat down after considering paying the $200 for a cabana just so we would not have to sit an inch away from strangers on either side of us. In addition you weren't allowed to bring water and bags are searched. If water is found they will make you throw it away or the security will not allow you in. Despite the friendliness of the staff and it's location I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Overall it was a rather gross experience. Honestly if I could have I would have gone back downstairs and immediately after check in and asked for a refund but we couldn't do so without a cancellation fee so we decided to stick it out. I wish we had though. 

The two nights before, we stayed in Tuscany Casino just off the strip and both of us wish we hadn't left. Even though it was 10 mins farther by walking we were better off with a more low key pool, and a room 3 times the size for a better price. Don't make the same mistake we did. Either pay more for a better hotel or stay at Tuscany if you don't mind walking farther.",0
